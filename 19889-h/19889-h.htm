<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap1_h.jpg" title="H" height="200" width="117" alt="H" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">ow</span> nice!" cried Bunny. "Mama
has sent for Miss Kerr, so I can do
exactly as I like for a little while.
I am very glad papa brought us
up here, for it is so pretty and so
cool, and these gardens are so lovely;" and
she gazed about her at the garden and the
lawn and then at the distant sea that lay just
beyond them, sparkling and dancing in the
sunshine. "If I had no governess," continued
the little girl, "and no lessons, and no nasty
nurse to say, 'Sit still, Miss Bunny,' and
'Don't make dirty your frock, Miss Bunny,' I
think I should be jolly&mdash;yes, that's papa's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
word, jolly. But, oh dear, big people are so
happy, for they can do what they like, but
<i>chindrel</i> must do everything they are told."
And quite forgetting her pretty white frock
and dainty sash, and the many orders she
had received not on any account to soil them,
she lay back comfortably upon the grass.</p>

<p>Bunny, whose real name was Ethel Dashwood,
was six years old, and was one of the
spoilt "<i>chindrel</i>," as she called children. If
she had had brothers and sisters, very likely
Bunny would have been kept in better order,
but as she was quite alone no one could bear
to correct her, and so she became very hard
to manage indeed. Her papa indulged her,
and thought she could do nothing wrong,
whilst her mama was so delicate that she
was very seldom able to look after her little
girl, and left her to the care of a kind-hearted,
but foolish old nurse, who allowed her to
have her own way in everything and never
for an instant thought of finding fault with
her.</p>

<p>This was all very well so long as Bunny
was no more than a baby, but when she came
to be six years old Mr. Dashwood suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
found that her little girl was much too
naughty, so she resolved to make a change
in the nursery, that would, she hoped, have
a good effect in every way. First of all old
nurse was sent away, and a trim French maid,
with a quick sharp manner, was engaged to
take her place.</p>

<p>Bunny was sorry to part with nurse, who
had always been kind to her, but Sophie was
so amusing, spoke such funny English, and
sang such merry songs that the little girl soon
ceased to fret, and became quite pleased with
her new maid.</p>

<p>The change of nurses Bunny bore in a
quiet way that surprised everyone in the
house; but when her mother told her that
she had arranged with a young lady to come
and live with them and be her governess, the
little girl burst into a passion, and stamping
her foot declared she would have no one to
teach her, that she would say no lessons, and
that her mama was very unkind to think
of such a thing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dashwood was greatly shocked, and
unable to understand such naughtiness, rang
the bell and ordered Sophie to take the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
away, and Bunny was carried off weeping
bitterly. But this fit of anger only made
her mama more anxious to have some one
to look after her daughter, and in a few days
the governess arrived, and Bunny was set
down to learn to read and write.</p>

<p>This was a great change for the neglected
child, and had her teacher been a sensible
person Bunny would doubtless have become
a good little girl in time. But unfortunately
the governess was very foolish, and thought
it much easier to allow her pupil to have her
own way than to take the trouble to make
her do what was right, and so instead of doing
the child good she did her harm, and
Bunny became more and more naughty every
day.</p>

<p>This was in June, and as London grew very
hot and dusty, Mrs. Dashwood declared they
must all go away to the country, and her
husband, who wished them to have a nice
holiday, went off at once and took a beautiful
house at Scarborough.</p>

<p>Bunny was enchanted, and made up her
mind to have great fun at the seaside, and
as the very day before they left town, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
governess was obliged to leave in a great
hurry on account of a death in her family,
the little girl made up her mind that she
was going to have perfect freedom to do
exactly what she liked and to play every
day upon the sea-beach. Sophie did not
trouble her much except when she was cross,
and so Bunny set off to Scarborough in very
high spirits.</p>

<p>The house her papa had taken for them
was a pretty rambling old place, standing on
a height just above the sea, and surrounded
by spreading trees and large gardens full of
sweet-scented flowers. A most charming
spot indeed, and to the little girl from hot
dusty London it seemed a perfect paradise.</p>

<p>The first days in the country passed away
very happily, and Bunny was not as wild as
might have been expected by those who knew
her, when one day, as she ran through the
hall, she stopped in astonishment before a
large trunk, and cried out to the butler, who
was standing near, "Who does that belong
to, Ashton? Has a visitor come to stay
with us?"</p>

<p>"A visitor, miss? No, a new governess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
miss&mdash;she's just gone in to speak to your
mama;" and he hurried away to his pantry.</p>

<p>"Nasty thing!" cried Bunny, stamping her
foot and growing very red and angry. Just
when I thought I was going to be happy all
by myself! But I'll be so naughty, and so
troublesome, that she'll soon go away. I'll be
ten times as hard to manage as I was before.
She'll not get hold of me to-night any way,
and scampering off into the garden she hid
herself among the trees.</p>

<p>But the new governess, Miss Kerr, was a
very different person from the last, and resolved
to do her best to make her little pupil
a good well-behaved child. She was a kind,
warm-hearted girl, who had a great many
small brothers and sisters of her own, and
she never doubted that in a short time
Bunny would become as good and obedient
as they were. She soon found, however,
that the task was not as easy as she had
fancied, and when she had been a few days
at Holly Lodge she began to fear that it
would be a very long time before her lectures
and advice would have the smallest
effect upon the wayward little child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>She had now been a whole week in charge
of the girl, and she feared that Bunny would
never learn to love her.</p>

<p>About half an hour before our story begins,
Bunny and her governess had been seated on
the lawn together. Mrs. Dashwood sent to
ask Miss Kerr to go to her for a few moments,
and that young lady had hastened
into the house, leaving her little charge upon
the grass with her book.</p>

<p>"Do not stir from here till I return, Bunny,"
she said; "you can go over that little
lesson again, and I shall not be long."</p>

<p>But as time went on and she did not
return the child grew restless, and feeling
very tired of sitting still, began to look about
to see what there was for her to do.</p>

<p>"Governesses are great bothers," she grumbled
to herself as she rolled about on the
grass. "And now as Miss Kerr does not
seem to be coming back, I think I will have
a climb up that tree&mdash;it looks so easy I'm
sure I could go up ever so high. There's
nobody looking, so I'll just see if I can go
right away up&mdash;as high as that little bird up
there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>Bunny was very quick in her movements,
and a minute later her white frock and blue
sash were fluttering about among the leaves
and branches of a fine old tree that grew in
the middle of the lawn.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! How lovely it would be to be
a bird&mdash;cheep, cheep! If I only had wings I
should just feel like one this minute, perched
up so high," she said with a merry laugh, as
she jumped and wriggled about on the branch.</p>

<p>But she quite forgot that the nursery window
overlooked the lawn, and that Sophie
was sure to be sitting there at her work. In
a moment, however, this fact was recalled to
her mind by the sound of a wild shriek from
the terrified maid.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle! Miss Bunny, you want to
kill yourself, or tear your sweet frock. Ah!
naughty child, get down this instants, or I will
tell monsieur your papa."</p>

<p>This was the one threat that had any power
to move Miss Bunny, so down she scrambled
and ran away as fast as she could over the
grass.</p>

<p>There was still no sign of Miss Kerr, so the
child wandered about, wondering what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
keeping her governess, and wishing she had
something to do, when all at once her eyes
fell on a beautiful rose-tree, almost weighed
down with the quantity of its flowers, and
she flew at it in delight and began to pull off
the lovely blossoms and pin one of them into
the front of her frock. But like most foolish
children she broke them off so short that there
was no stalk left with which to fasten them,
and so the poor rose fell upon the ground,
and the little girl impatiently snatched at
another and dragged it ruthlessly from the
branch. This went on for some time, and
would probably have gone on until not a
flower remained upon the bush, had not
Sophie again made herself heard from the
nursery window.</p>

<p>"Miss Bunny, how can you derange the
beautiful roses?" she cried indignantly.
"There will be not one left to give to your
papa when he comes home, and you know he
loves those sweet flowers so much."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry," cried Bunny. "But
there are some dear little buds, and I will
just leave them for papa. Who knows perhaps
they may be roses by to-morrow even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>ing!"
and away she flitted like a white-winged
butterfly in search of some other
sweet flowers that she might make her own,
without fear of further interruption from
sharp-tongued Sophie.</p>

<p>At last, when she had such a large bouquet
that her little hands could scarcely hold it,
she wearied of her occupation, and stepping
softly to the drawing-room window, she
peeped in just to see what Miss Kerr and
her mama could be doing that kept them
shut up there for so long together.</p>

<p>"I'll take mama these flowers," she said
to herself, "and I am sure they will make
her headache better. I'll just tap gently at
the window and Miss Kerr will let me in,
and I'll be so good and quiet that mama
will not mind me being with her while she
talks."</p>

<p>Bunny waited for some minutes, hoping to
be admitted to the room, but no notice was
taken of her knocking&mdash;for the ladies were
too much absorbed in their own affairs to
trouble themselves about her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dashwood lay on the sofa, and her
face had a flushed anxious expression, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
listened to Miss Kerr, who was seated on a
stool by her side, and seemed to be talking
very earnestly, but her voice was low, and as
the window was shut Bunny could not hear
a word she said.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, what a lot Miss Kerr has got
to say!" cried the little girl impatiently. "She
seems as if she had forgotten all about me.
I am tired of being out here all alone, so I'll
just run in and play with my dollies."</p>

<p>Now the nearest way into the house was
up a flight of steps and in by the dining-room
window, which was like a large glass
door, and always lay open in the most tempting
manner possible.</p>

<p>So up these steps went Miss Bunny, her
hands full of flowers and her mind bent on
mischief, if she could only meet with anything
to do that would amuse her and give
her some fun.</p>

<h5 class="caption" style="padding-bottom: 2em;">THE BUTLER SURPRISES BUNNY.</h5>

<p>The room into which she stepped was a
very pretty one. It was very nearly round,
with many high windows looking out upon
the pleasant grounds and blue sparkling sea.
Upon the walls were pictures of fine thoroughbred
horses, some of them with their little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
foals beside them, others with a surly-looking
old dog or a tiny kitten, their favourite stable
companion and friend. Bunny loved these
pictures and had given the horses pet names of
her own, by which she insisted on calling them,
although their own well-known names were
printed under them, for they were all horses
that had won a great number of races during
their lives, and so had become celebrated.</p>

<p>The round table in the middle of the room
was laid ready for dinner, and looked very
inviting with its prettily arranged flowers,
handsome silver, and shining glass.</p>

<p>"Dear me, how nice it all looks!" said
Bunny, as she marched round the table on
tip-toe. "One, two, three, four places. Why,
it must be for company. Well, I hope there
will be somebody nice to talk to me. I must
get Sophie to put on my pretty new frock.
But oh, dear, what fun it would be just to
put a tiny, little drop of water into every
glass! Wouldn't old Ashton wonder&mdash;just
when he thinks everything is nice for dinner?
I will! I'll do it! It will be such fun! Oh,
I'd like to see his face; won't he be horribly
angry?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Throwing her flowers on the floor, Bunny
sprang to the side-board, and seizing a water-jug
she climbed up on each chair in turn
and poured a few drops of water into every
glass all round the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Just as she came to the last wine-glass and
held the jug ready to let the water fall into
it, the door opened suddenly and the solemn-looking
old butler entered the room.</p>

<p>"Miss Bunny!" he exclaimed, and he looked
so stern and angry that the little girl felt
frightened, and dropping the jug, scrambled
off the chair, seized her flowers, and ran out
of his sight as fast as she could.</p>

<p>"I only did it for fun, Ashton," she called
back from the door. "It is clean water, so it
won't do any harm."</p>

<p>"Harm, indeed!" grumbled Ashton; "just
as I thought I had everything done until
dinner time. Now I must begin and rub up all
this glass again;" and he began at once to remove
the glasses from the table. "Little himp
that she is, that Miss Bunny! A perfect
himp, and if I had the governessing of her
for sometime I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;bah! there's that bell
again! Some folks is in a mighty hurry,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and full of anger and indignation against the
little girl whom he could not punish for her
naughty trick, Ashton hurried to the hall
door, longing for something upon which he
could vent his wrath.</p>

<p>Bunny was skipping merrily in the hall,
and the pretty roses that she had gathered
with so much pleasure lay scattered on the
ground. This sight did not tend to put the
butler in a better temper, but he made no
remark, and passing by the little girl without
a word he opened the hall door with a
jerk. A poor boy with a thin pinched face
stood upon the step.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, will you give me a bit
of bread, for I am very hungry?" he said in
an imploring voice, as he gazed up into the
butler's face.</p>

<p>"There's nothing for you. How dare you
come here with your wretched lies?" cried
Ashton fiercely, and he shut the door with
a bang.</p>

<p>"That's not true, Ashton," cried Bunny
darting forward and opening the door again.
"Wait, little boy, and I will get you something!"
and before the astonished butler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
knew where he was, she had rushed into the
dining-room, and came back carrying a large
loaf and a pat of butter that she had found
upon the side-board.</p>

<p>"You must not give that away, Miss
Bunny," cried the man; "that is in my charge,
and I cannot allow you to give it to a beggar;"
and he tried to drag the bread from her
hands.</p>

<p>"You nasty man! I will give it to him if
I like," she screamed. "My papa always lets
me do what I like, and you are only a servant&mdash;and
I will give it;" and she struggled
to get away from him. "I only put the
water in your glasses for fun&mdash;but I'm very
glad I did it&mdash;and I wish I had put dirty
water in&mdash;and I wish&mdash;let me go&mdash;I'll tell
papa, and he'll be very angry and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bunny," said a soft reproachful voice,
"my dear child, what is the matter?" and
Miss Kerr laid her hand gently upon the
little girl's shoulder.</p>

<p>"That nasty Ashton won't let me give
this loaf to a poor boy who is there begging,"
cried Bunny; "he's very hungry and I want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ashton is quite right, Bunny," said Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Kerr gently; "give him back the loaf, dear.
It is not yours, so you have no right to give
it away. Have you no money of your own
to give the boy?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not," cried Bunny bursting
into tears, "and I am sure papa would not
mind my giving the loaf away&mdash;he never does.
Ashton's a nasty, cross old thing;" and she
flung the loaf on the floor.</p>

<p>"Ashton is only doing his duty, Bunny,
and you must not speak in that way."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish he wouldn't do his duty
then," sobbed the little girl; "it's a great
shame of him to do his duty, when I tell
him not."</p>

<p>"Come, now, dear, dry your eyes and give
this to the poor boy," said Miss Kerr kindly;
"see, I will lend you threepence to give to
him, and when your papa gives you some
pocket-money you can repay me. The boy
will like the money better than the bread,
I daresay, and you will feel that you are
giving something that is really your own."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you!" cried Bunny
with delight, her tears drying up in an instant.
"You are good! You are kind!" and throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>ing
her arms round Miss Kerr's neck she
kissed her over and over again; then seizing
the pennies she flew to the door, and handing
them to the boy said in a subdued voice:
"Here, boy, a good lady gave me these pennies
for you. I am a greedy little girl and spend
all my own money on sweets, but I'll save
up and pay Miss Kerr back very soon."</p>

<p>"That is enough, Bunny," said the governess,
taking the child by the hand. "I have
something to tell you, dear, so come with me
now."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will come," answered Bunny
quite meekly, and shutting the door, she
followed Miss Kerr down the hall.</p>

<h3>PLEASANT NEWS FOR BUNNY.</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap2_a.jpg" title="A" height="200" width="116" alt="A" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">nd</span> now, Bunny," said Miss Kerr,
as she led the little girl into the
library and took her on her knee,
"I am afraid you have been a very
naughty child. I do not like to
scold you, you know, but when children are
told to stay in one place they should do so,
and not run about all over the house in the
way you seem to have been doing."</p>

<p>"But you were so long away," replied
Bunny, "and I was tired sitting there all by
myself. Sophie kept screaming at me not
to touch the flowers, so I had nothing to
do."</p>

<p>"And what about the lesson? Did you
learn that?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, it was so stupid," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Bunny, "I got quite tired of it, and all the
letters went wrong, so I thought I would go
to the nursery and play with my toys, and
then when I went into the dining-room there
was nobody there, and I thought it would be
great fun to tease old Ashton, so I jumped
on the chairs and poured water into all the
glasses, and he was so angry; and oh it was
fun to see his face when he cried out, 'Miss
Bunny!'" and carried away with delight at
the recollection of her naughty trick, the
little girl clapped her hands and laughed long
and merrily.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, do you not know that
that was extremely naughty conduct?" said
Miss Kerr gravely. "It is very wicked to
make anyone angry, and it was very unkind
of you to play such a trick upon Ashton.
How would you like if he were to spoil your
toys or break your dolls for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't like it at all," answered
Bunny; "I'd be awfully cross, and I'd get
papa to send him away. That would be a
good way to punish him, I know."</p>

<p>"Well, Bunny, you think you could punish
him but he has no way of punishing you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
so you should always be very careful not
to annoy or trouble him. Besides, my child,
we should never do anything to other people
that we know we would not like them to do
to us. God wishes us to be good and kind
to everyone about us, remember, and to be
unkind is to disobey Him."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, I'm very sorry that I was so
naughty," cried Bunny, "for Sophie told
me this morning that God has been good
and kind to me always, for she says He gave
me all the nice things I have, and my papa
and mama, so I should not like to vex Him
when He has been so kind to me."</p>

<p>"If my little Bunny will just remember
that, whenever she feels inclined to be naughty
she will soon find it easy to be good, and she
will be a much happier child, for then she
will know that she is pleasing God who has
been good to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will try, dear Miss Kerr, indeed I
will," said the little girl; "I'll be good and
kind to God, and you, and papa, and mama,
because you are all so good to me;" and she
laid her soft cheek against Miss Kerr's face.</p>

<p>"That is right, darling," said the governess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
with a smile; "and now that I have given
you a little lecture, and you have promised
to be good, I have a piece of news to tell
you that will, I am sure, give you great pleasure;"
and she smoothed the child's fair hair
with her hand.</p>

<p>"Good news! Oh, dear Miss Kerr, do tell
me what it is," cried the little girl eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, I have been having a long talk with
your mama, Bunny, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know that. I saw you talk,
talk, talk, only I couldn't hear what you
were saying, because the window was shut."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not, dear, but listen. Your
mama says you have an uncle in India who
has a little son of seven years old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that, Miss Kerr! Why, that's
no news! Of course I know about Uncle
Jim and Cousin Mervyn. I never saw them
though, but still I know they are in India, an
awfully hot place it is, Sophie says."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it is. But would you like to see
this Cousin Mervyn, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd just love to see him&mdash;but is he
black? Sophie says the people in those countries
are black. Oh, I shouldn't like a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
cousin, Miss Kerr, indeed I should not," cried
Bunny in a piteous voice.</p>

<p>"You little goose, he's not black at all,"
cried Miss Kerr, laughing at the little girl's
look of consternation; "I have never seen him,
but his papa is supposed to be like your
mama, so I daresay he will have fair hair,
blue eyes, and pink cheeks something very
like your own."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad he is like that, for indeed I
could not bear a black cousin. Once I had
a black doll given to me for a present, and I
screamed and screamed till nurse put it away
out of the nursery."</p>

<p>"It is certainly very lucky that your cousin
is not black, for it would never do to scream
at him, would it?" said Miss Kerr, "for he has
arrived in London and is coming here with
your papa to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am glad! Oh, I am glad!" sang
Bunny, dancing round the room on the points
of her toes. "What fun it will be to have a
little cousin to play with! Will he stay long,
Miss Kerr?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a long time, Bunny," answered the
governess. "It is too hot in India for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to stay there any longer&mdash;indeed they think
he has stayed there too long already, and
your mama has promised to take care of him
until he is old enough to go to school."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be a nice long visit," said
the little girl; "he'll be staying with us just
as if it was home, and he was my own
brother."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, just so. He will be like your
brother, I am sure; and he is to have his
lessons with you. I am to teach you both."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'll lend him my pony and I'll
let him play with my kittens. And oh, Miss
Kerr, I'll give him tea out of my own little
tea-set; and we'll have such fun."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, it will be very nice, and I hope
that little Bunny will be a good child and not
make her cousin naughty and teach him mischievous
tricks."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be good, indeed, dear Miss Kerr.
I won't want to be naughty so much when
I have someone to play with, for it's always
when I feel lonely that I want to play tricks
on people."</p>

<p>"Is that so really, you poor mite? Well,
you will not be lonely any more, Bunny, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
I hope you will try hard and learn to read
soon. When children can read they do not
want a companion so much, because they can
read pretty stories about other children and
so amuse themselves for hours together."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to read stories one bit,"
said Bunny with a pout. "Sophie and
mama read lots of stories to me, so it
doesn't matter whether I can read them for
myself or not."</p>

<p>"And what will you do when you grow
up, Bunny? Don't you think you would feel
very much ashamed if you could not read
when you had grown to be a tall lady?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no one would ever know, for I am
sure people never ask grown-up ladies if they
can read. Do they, now? No one ever asks
you or mama if you know how to read."</p>

<p>"No, people never ask us if we can read,
certainly, Bunny," answered Miss Kerr laughing,
"but they would soon find out if we did
not, I can tell you. People who cannot read
seldom learn those things that everyone
should know, and so they are ignorant and
stupid. Surely you would not like Mervyn
to beat you at his lessons, would you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>"Oh, but he's older than me," said Bunny,
"and, of course, he knows a great deal more
than me, and<span style="letter-spacing: -2px;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>"</p>

<p>"Than <i>I</i>, Bunny, say he is older than <i>I</i>
am," corrected Miss Kerr. "Yes, he is older,
but I do not think he knows more than you
do. His papa says he has never been taught
anything but his letters, and he can hardly
speak English."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Does he only speak French
then?" said Bunny with a look of alarm.</p>

<p>"No, Hindustanee. That is the Indian
language, you know, and as he always had a
native nurse he does not know English very
perfectly. But we will soon teach him, won't
we, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it will be fun, and I'll try very
hard to learn to read well before he does! It
will be nice to have a cousin, won't it? I
wonder what he's like. But I'm sure he'll
be nice. I know he will. Don't you think
he'll be nice, Miss Kerr?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I think it is very likely, but
you will know all about him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish to-morrow would come, quick,
quick!" cried Bunny; "the days and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
hours go over so slowly, and I do want to
see that little Indian."</p>

<p>"Poor little boy! I daresay he will be
very tired and shy when he arrives. It is a
sad thing to leave father and friends and
come among strangers, Bunny," said Miss
Kerr, and there were tears in her eyes as she
gazed out over the garden.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Kerr, why should you feel
sorry for Mervyn? I'm so glad that he is
coming here," said Bunny softly, and she put
her little hand into Miss Kerr's. "Why
should you cry for him? We will be very
kind to him, you and I, and papa and
mama."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, of course," answered Miss
Kerr stroking the little hand. "But I was
not thinking of Mervyn, but of someone I
know, who had to leave her dear home, her
father and mother, and brothers and sisters,
to go be governess to a wild little girl, who
did not care to learn her lessons and did not
love her at all."</p>

<p>"Why, that's like me and you! But I do
love you; oh, I do love you!" cried the child,
and she flung her arms round Miss Kerr's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
neck. "You are so good and kind, and I am
sorry you had to leave your little brothers
and sisters, and I won't be wild, and I'll love
you very much."</p>

<p>"If you do, Bunny, you will make me
very happy, and I think you will soon be a
very good little girl," and Miss Kerr kissed
the eager face over and over again. "But
run away now and get ready for tea. I have
some letters to write for the post, and I shall
just have time if you run off at once."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bunny jumping off Miss
Kerr's knee. "I must go to tell Sophie
the news." And away she ran, calling,
"Sophie, Sophie," as she went up the stairs.</p>

<p>"She has a good little heart, and will become
a fine character in time, if she is properly
managed," said Miss Kerr to herself as
the child left the room. "But she has been
terribly spoilt and neglected. If the boy
from India is as great a pickle as Miss
Bunny, I shall have my hands very full
indeed," and with something between a sigh
and a laugh, Miss Kerr seated herself at the
table and began to write her letters.</p>

<h3>BUNNY GETS UP EARLY.</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap3_f.jpg" title="F" height="200" width="117" alt="F" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">or</span> a long time after she went to bed
that night, Bunny could not go to
sleep, and lay tossing about from
side to side, wishing over and over
again that it was morning, that she
might get up and put all her toys and books
in order, so that they should look as nice as
possible when she came to show them to
the new cousin.</p>

<p>At last she dropped off into a sound sleep,
and did not wake again until the sun was
shining brightly into her room. She jumped
up and looked about to see if Sophie had
gone to get her bath ready. But the maid
lay fast asleep in her bed at the other side
of the room, and poor Bunny felt sure she
would not get up for a very long time yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
She felt ready to cry at the thoughts of lying
there for so long doing nothing, whilst the
sun was shining so brightly over the sea and
dancing so merrily up and down the nursery
walls. Suddenly, however, a happy idea
presented itself to her mind, and she sprang
out of her crib with a soft well-pleased little
laugh.</p>

<p>"It will be such fun," she whispered to
herself, "and Sophie will get such a start
when she sees the crib empty! But I must
go about very gently or she might wake up
and send me back to bed."</p>

<p>So the little girl slipped very quietly about
the room, and struggled bravely with buttons
and tapes, as she did her best to dress herself
without the assistance of her maid.</p>

<p>"They're all upside down and tied in big
knots," she said ruefully, "but Sophie will
just have to do them all over again when
she gets up. Oh, dear, where are my boots,
I wonder? I can't see them anywhere about.
Well, I must go out in these, I suppose;" and
sitting down on the floor she put on a pair
of dainty Queen Anne shoes, with satin bows
and steel stars, that she had worn the even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>ing
before when she went down to the drawing-room
to see her mama.</p>

<p>At this moment Sophie turned round with
a loud snore, and Bunny gave a start of
alarm, as she looked quickly towards the
bed. If Sophie awoke and saw what she
was doing, all her fun would surely be
spoiled, and she would be sent back to her
crib in disgrace.</p>

<p>Very cautiously then she got up off the
floor, seized her hat that lay on the chest
of drawers, and opening the door as softly
as possible, flew along the corridor and away
down the stairs.</p>

<p>Not a servant was to be seen about, for it
was not yet seven o'clock, and so Bunny
passed on without any interruption into the
dining-room, and stood on tip-toe at the side-board
looking anxiously to see if there was
anything there for her to eat. But there was
not even a crust to be seen.</p>

<p>"Nasty old Ashton!" she cried, "he might
have left a few pieces of bread for me; but
he wouldn't, I'm sure, even if he had known
I was coming. I must get something for
my dear pony, now that I am up, so I'll go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
off to the larder and see what I can find
there."</p>

<p>So away went Bunny in high glee at her
clever thought; but when she arrived at the
larder door she found it locked, and she
was about to turn away sad and disappointed
when a sudden jingling of keys was
heard in the passage, the kitchen door opened,
and Mrs. Brown, the cook, appeared upon the
scene.</p>

<p>"Miss Bunny, dear, what brings you here
at such an hour? And law but you are
dressed queer! But, indeed, them Frenchies
are little good with their new-fangled ways.
It's nurse that used to dress you smart, deary,
and as for Sophie, she beats all;" and the good
woman held up her hands in dismay at the
child's untidy appearance.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sophie didn't dress me at all!" cried
Bunny. "She doesn't even know I'm up,
for she's fast asleep. But I was so tired lying
there listening to Sophie snoring that I
thought I would get up and go out. I want
to take my pony a piece of bread, so please
give me some for him and some for myself,
Mrs. Brown, for I'm very hungry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>"Bless your heart, of course I will," cried
the good-natured woman, as she unlocked the
door, and cutting two large slices of bread
and butter, handed them to the little girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," said Bunny; "Frisk will
like this, I am sure. Good morning, Mrs.
Brown, and mind you don't tell Sophie where
I am, if she comes to look for me."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, deary, I won't give her
any news of you. I don't admire her and
her stuck-up French airs, so she won't get
much out of me."</p>

<p>But Bunny did not wait to hear the end
of the good woman's speech against poor
Sophie; she had got all she wanted, so away
she ran to pay her morning visit to her little
pony.</p>

<p>When Frisk heard the stable door opening
and a footstep approaching his stall, he
whisked his tail and twisted his head as well
as he could, to see who was coming to visit
him at such an early hour. And when he
found it was his little mistress, and heard her
voice at his ear he neighed with delight, and
rubbed his velvety nose up and down her
frock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>"Dear old Frisk," she cried, patting his
neck, "there's a little cousin coming all the
way from India to stay with us. Sophie is
not glad, but I am, and Miss Kerr is, and
you must be glad too, old man. And he's
not black at all, Frisk, oh, no, and it is very,
very silly of you to think so, sir. You must
be good to him, dear little pony, and give
him nice rides, and then he'll love you, just
as I do, and we'll all be friends together. So
now eat this, little Frisk," she continued, and
breaking off a piece of the bread, she held it
up to the pony's nose.</p>

<p>But suddenly Bunny gave a little shriek,
and drew her hand quickly away; for without
intending it, Frisk had actually bitten
his kind little mistress. The bread she
offered him was so small, and his mouth was
so big, that the child's fingers got rather far
in among his teeth, and when Frisk's white
grinders came down upon the dainty offered
him, they met rather sharply upon poor
Bunny's thumb. The skin was slightly cut,
and as a little stream of blood ran down her
finger the child grew frightened and began
to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>"Oh, Frisk, Frisk, why did you bite? I
never thought you would do such a thing,"
she cried reproachfully. "I never, never knew
you do such a thing before;" and sinking
down on the straw by his side, she tried to
stop the blood by rolling her finger tightly
up in the corner of her pinafore. "Just when
I wanted to tell the new cousin that you
were a good, kind pony, you go and bite me&mdash;oh
dear, oh dear, I am very sorry, Frisk, I
am indeed."</p>

<p>But in spite of the little girl's sorrowful
lecture, Frisk did not in the least know that
he had done anything wrong, and poking his
soft nose into Bunny's lap, he carried off the
remaining piece of bread and ate it with
much relish.</p>

<p>"You artful old thing," cried Bunny, delighted
with his cleverness, and smiling
through her tears, "if you hadn't bit me I'd
have said you were the best and dearest little
pony alive;" and forgetting her anger at him
for hurting her, she jumped up and patted
and kissed his soft silky nose.</p>

<p>"Where is Mademoiselle Bunny? Ah!
that child will be the death of me. Jean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
have you seen Meess Bunny anywhere about?"
cried Sophie, just outside the stable door;
and the little girl knew that her hour was
come and that she was going to get a good
scolding.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Bunny is in there, talking to
Frisk, Mamzelle Sophie," answered the groom.</p>

<p>"Little naughty one! Ah, these English
children are so dreadful!" cried Sophie, and
in a moment Bunny was dragged out from
her seat on the straw and carried away to
the nursery.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she screamed as soon as they were
inside the door, "what is that I see on your
dress, mademoiselle? Blood, I declare! Oh,
what will your mama say? She will send
away that beast of a pony I am sure, and then
you will not make such early walks to the
stable."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sophie, Sophie, don't tell! don't tell!"
cried Bunny, "Frisk did not mean to hurt
me I am sure, and it's nearly well now.
Look, it has stopped bleeding already, so
don't tell mama, pray don't," and the little
girl raised her eyes full of tears to the maid's
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>"Well, I won't tell if you will promise
me never to slip out of your bed and away
out of the house again as you have done just
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never will, I never will, Sophie!"
cried Bunny, "but do say you won't tell. I
couldn't bear to see Frisk sent away."</p>

<p>"Well, well, don't cry any more," said
Sophie good-naturedly. "Be a good enfant,
and I will say not anything about it."</p>

<p>"Oh! you dear, darling Sophie, I'll be so
good, so good!" cried the little girl, "I'll be
so good that you'll never have to scold me
any more."</p>

<p>"Ma foi, what a change that will be!"
cried Sophie, "if you get so good as all that
I will send for the doctor."</p>

<p>"For the doctor!" exclaimed Bunny in
surprise. "Why would you send for him?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, mademoiselle, because I
will surely think you are ill if you get to be
an angel like that; but I am very certain I
shall have to scold you many times before
this evening comes."</p>

<p>"Very likely, Sophie, but still I'm good
now," said Bunny with a merry little laugh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and as the maid gave the last touch to her
hair, the last pull to her sash, she ran out of
the nursery and away to her mama with
whom she always had her breakfast.</p>

<p>Bunny was in a wild state of excitement
all that day, and Sophie and Miss Kerr found
it very hard to keep her in order and prevent
her disturbing her mama, who was not
well, and could not bear much noise.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, how long the day is! How long
the day is!" she cried over and over again.
"I don't think evening will ever come, Miss
Kerr, I don't, indeed."</p>

<p>"It will come fast enough, Bunny dear,
if you will only have patience. Try and
forget that you are expecting anything to
happen."</p>

<p>"I wish I could! I wish I could! But I
do so wish to see what Mervyn is like."</p>

<p>"You impatient little goose, do try and
think of something else and time will go over
much faster. But I tell you what, Bun,"
said Miss Kerr, when they had finished their
early dinner, "we will go and take a good
run on the sands and that will pass the afternoon
very nicely for us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>"But they might come when we are away,
and that would be dreadful."</p>

<p>"No, they won't, because they can't," said
Miss Kerr with a smile. "The train does
not come in until seven, and it is only three
now, so you see we have plenty of time for
a nice walk."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap4_d.jpg" title="D" height="200" width="112" alt="D" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">o</span> be quick, Sophie," cried Bunny as
she rushed into the nursery after
her walk upon the sands, "Miss
Kerr says it is half-past five, and
papa and Mervyn will be here at
seven, so do be quick and dress me as fast as
ever you can, for I want to be down in the
hall, ready to jump out at them the minute
they come to the door."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Sophie without moving from
her chair at the window. "What haste we
are in, certainly. But you may just keep
still, Miss Bunny, for I am not going to
touch you for one half hour. What is the
use for me to dress you now, when long before
seven you would be so black as a sweep
again, I know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>"Oh, what a bother!" cried Bunny, stamping
her foot and flinging her pretty white
hat upon the floor. "You are a nasty thing,
and I wish you had not come to be my maid
at all, for you never do anything I ask you
to do. I wish dear old nurse was back with
me again, she used to be so nice, and always
did whatever I wanted."</p>

<p>"Old nurse was an old silly," answered
Sophie, stitching away at her work. "She
neg-lect you and make you so naughty, and
it is for me to keep you in order and make
you good."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't be kept in order, and I
won't be made good&mdash;not one bit," cried
Bunny bursting into tears. "It's very unkind
of you not to dress me in time to see my
papa, and he'll be very angry with you."</p>

<h5 class="caption" style="padding-bottom: 2em;">BUNNY WELCOMES HER FATHER.</h5>

<p>"Come, Miss Bunny, don't be a silly baby,"
said Sophie, "I'll dress you soon enough, do
not fear that. You had so much best go
and make tidy that doll's house, for the little
cousin will be ashamed to see it in so much
of disorder."</p>

<p>"I don't want to tidy my doll's house, and
I don't care whether Mervyn likes it or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
not, not a bit!" said Bunny, and taking off
one little glove she threw it into the very
furthest corner of the room, and then rolling
the other into a ball she threw it at
Sophie's head as she sat bending over her
work.</p>

<p>But the maid did not take the slightest
notice of the young lady, and without another
word went quietly on with her sewing.</p>

<p>When Bunny saw that Sophie was really
determined not to dress her for some time,
she sat down on the floor in silence, and leaning
her head up against the side of her crib,
kicked about for some minutes in a very ill-tempered
way indeed. After a while she
grew tired of this conduct, which to her great
surprise did not seem to make Sophie the
least bit angry, and not knowing what to do
with herself she sat staring about the room
with a very sulky expression on her little face.</p>

<p>But by degrees the tears dried up, the cross
look disappeared, and jumping suddenly to
her feet, she trotted off to the other end of
the room. Pulling open the wide door of
the doll's house, she set to work very industriously
to put it in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>She brushed the carpets, dusted the chairs,
shook out the dolls' dresses and set them out
in the drawing-room as if they were waiting
to receive their visitors.</p>

<p>"Now it's tidy, Sophie," she cried with a
bright little smile. "Mervyn will think it a
very nice doll's house. Won't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear enfant, I am sure he will,"
said Sophie kindly, "and now as you have
been good and quiet for so long, I will begin
to dress you if you like."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a dear good Sophie. I am so
afraid that I shall not be ready when papa
comes."</p>

<p>"You will be ready, never fear," said
Sophie, and taking off the child's frock, she
began to wash her face and hands.</p>

<p>"You hurt, Sophie, you hurt," cried Bunny
pettishly, as the maid combed out her long
fair hair.</p>

<p>"Bah, no I don't hurt you, mademoiselle,
except when you pull your head aside. But
in truth it is hard to comb your hair properly
when you move and fidget about. You are
very difficult to manage to-day."</p>

<p>"I tell you, you do hurt me&mdash;you pull as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
hard as anything," cried Bunny growing very
red.</p>

<p>"Very well, miss, if you are in such
humour," cried Sophie, "you may just stand
there till you get back to your temper again.
I'm going into the next room to get your
frock, and I hope that when I come back
you will be quiet and let me dress your hair
like a little lady," and the maid flounced out
of the nursery, leaving Bunny standing before
the glass in her short white petticoat,
with one shoe off and the other on, her hair
hanging in disorder about her shoulders, and
her face puckered up in dismay at Sophie's
sudden and unexpected departure.</p>

<p>"Oh, why was I so cross about my hair?"
she cried. "Papa and Mervyn will be here
directly, and just look at the state I am in.
What shall I do? What shall I do? Sophie,
I'll be good. Do come back, and get me
ready to go down."</p>

<p>But Sophie did not answer, nor did she
return, and poor Bunny sat down on the edge
of her crib, and in spite of all the efforts she
made to keep them back, the big tears rolled
slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Suddenly the sound of wheels was heard
upon the gravel below, and brushing away
her tears, the little girl started to her feet
and ran over to the window.</p>

<p>A cab covered with luggage was coming
in at the big gate, and in a minute she saw
her papa nodding gaily up to his little Bunny,
with a bright well-pleased smile upon his
dear face.</p>

<p>Without a moment's thought as to the
state she was in, or of what her papa or the
little boy from India might think of her in
such a condition, Bunny dropped the blind,
and with a joyful cry of "Papa, papa, my
own dear papa," she rushed out of the nursery
and away down the stairs.</p>

<p>"My little darling! My sweet little Bun,"
exclaimed Mr. Dashwood, as the small wild-looking
figure came running along the hall
and jumped into his arms. "Why, dear, why
did you come out of the nursery before you
were dressed?" he said, as he smoothed back
the ruffled hair and kissed the hot cheeks of
the excited child. "You are in a strange
state to receive visitors, Bunny dear, and I
am afraid cousin Mervyn will be shocked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
my wild girl, for he is a very tidy little man,
I can tell you. Mervyn, this is your cousin
Ethel, commonly called Bunny, I hope you
will be very good friends," and he put out his
hand to a pale gentle-looking boy of about
seven years old, who was clinging shyly to
the skirts of an Indian Ayah, as though afraid
to let her go from beside him for an instant.</p>

<p>When Bunny raised her head from her
papa's shoulder to look at her new cousin, her
eyes suddenly lighted upon the grinning
black face of the strange foreign-looking
woman, and with one wild yell of terror she
turned away, and buried her little face in her
father's coat.</p>

<p>"Oh, send that dreadful thing away!" she
cried, "I'm not half so naughty as I used to
be! And I have promised Miss Kerr to be
so good! Oh, papa, papa, don't give your
little Bunny to that dreadful black woman."</p>

<p>"My darling, that is Mervyn's nurse, and
he loves her very dearly. See how he clings
to her and begs her to stay with him! Just
look how kind she is to him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, papa, she's a bogie, I am sure,"
cried the child, clinging to him more ner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>vously
than ever. "Sophie always tells me
a bogie will come for me if I am naughty,
and I was naughty just now because Sophie
pulled my hair, and I was cross, and cried
and stamped my foot and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My poor foolish little girl, she is not a
bogie, but a good kind woman&mdash;her face is
black, but she can't help that. It was very
wrong of Sophie to frighten you about bogies,
very wrong&mdash;there is no such thing in the
world."</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur, monsieur, I'm so sorry
Meess Bunny has been so naughty to run down
to you in such a state," cried Sophie running
into the hall with a very angry look on her
face. "I just left her for a minute to get
her frock, and when I came back she was
gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sophie, Sophie, don't scold me, please,"
cried Bunny, "I'll go back to the nursery,
and let you dress me now. Oh, take me
away quick, for if I see that dreadful face, I
shall scream again, I know I shall;" and
with one little hand over her eyes that she
might not see the terrible creature again,
Bunny flung herself into Sophie's arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
was carried off upstairs to have her toilet
completed for dinner.</p>

<p>"Poor little monkey!" said Mr. Dashwood
laughing, "I never thought she would be so
easily frightened. Ashton, take the nurse
down to the housekeeper's room, and tell
the servants to look after her, and give her
her dinner. Come, Mervyn, my little man,
I want to take you to see your aunt."</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle," answered the little boy in a
shy nervous voice, and looking up into the
Ayah's face to see what she wished him to do.</p>

<p>"Go at once," she said in Hindustanee,
and then Mervyn went up to his uncle, and
putting his little hand into his, allowed him
to lead him down the passage to the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="figleft"><img src="images/chap5_m.jpg" title="M" height="200" width="117" alt="M" /></p>
<p><span class="smcap">rs Dashwood</span> lay on the sofa
in the drawing-room, and Miss
Kerr sat beside her reading aloud.</p>

<p>The two children, Bunny and
Mervyn, were seated side by side
upon a large white woolly rug in the bow-window,
and they whispered together in
very low tones lest they should disturb the
ladies by their noise.</p>

<p>Bunny was nursing a pretty black kitten,
with a red ribbon round its neck, whilst
Mervyn sat with his little hands clasped
over his knees, looking out at the blue
sparkling sea, with a well-pleased expression
on his thin pale face.</p>

<p>"What a lovely cool place England is!"
he whispered; "it feels so comfortable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
nice here, and that sea is so beautiful to
look at."</p>

<p>"Yes, to look at," answered Bunny, nodding
her head; "but, oh! Mervyn, wouldn't
you feel afraid to go into it, and have your
face stuck right under the water, and held
there till you had no breath, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be horrible!" cried Mervyn
with a frightened look; "my papa
would be angry if I were put into the sea in
that way. Oh! I will write and tell him
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I know he wrote to say that bathing
would be very good for you," said
Bunny, "and mama told Miss Kerr this
very morning she was sure it would be.
But I tell you, Mervyn, it's only Sophie that
is so rough and nasty. One day I went to
bathe with Miss Kerr, and it was lovely!
She told me when she was going to dip me,
and she let me play at the edge, and I took
dolly in and I dipped her, and it was such fun."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will ask Miss Kerr always
to bathe me," replied Mervyn; "I should die,
I am sure, if I were pushed under the water
and could not get my breath."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"Oh! I was often and often pushed down
that way by Sophie, and I didn't die at all;
but I kicked and screamed most dreadfully,"
cried Bunny; "but then, mama says I am
very strong, and Sophie said last night that
you were a misserble creature, so thin and
white."</p>

<p>"Sophie is very rude!" exclaimed Mervyn
with a slight flush; "I am not a miserable
creature; I can't help being white;
everyone is in India, because it's so hot."</p>

<p>"That is funny!" cried the little girl, "for
Sophie said all Indians were black, and I
thought you would have a little black face
like Pussy here, only Miss Kerr told me you
would be as white as me; but you're whiter,
much whiter," and she laid her small plump
pink hand on Mervyn's thin white one.</p>

<p>"I don't like your Sophie," cried Mervyn
impatiently; "she talks in such a queer way,
and she's not half so nice as my dear old
Indian nurse. I do wish she had been able
to stay in England with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think she was a horrid fright!"
cried Bunny, "with her nasty black face
and her dreadful flappy wild dress, and I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sure nobody could understand a word she
said."</p>

<p>"I could," said Mervyn with a sigh, "and
I liked talking Hindustanee much better
than English."</p>

<p>"But it sounds so silly!" cried Bunny;
"I think it's a great pity people shouldn't
always speak English everywhere, for that
would be so plain and easy."</p>

<p>"Well, I would much rather everyone
would speak Hindustanee, for that would be
much nicer."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I don't think so," said Bunny;
"and I think you speak English very well."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Mervyn, smiling; "papa
did not; and do you know, I can't always
think of the right words for things."</p>

<p>"Oh! just ask me and I will tell you,"
replied Bunny jauntily, "for I never have to
think for my words at all."</p>

<p>"Bunny, dear," said Mrs. Dashwood from
her sofa, "I think you have nursed that
kitten quite long enough; the poor little
thing looks very tired. Put it into its basket
like a good child."</p>

<p>"Very well, mama," answered Bunny, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
jumping up, she ran over to a corner of the
room where stood a pretty round basket,
which was always used as a snug bed for
Miss Puss.</p>

<p>Bunny dropped her pet gently in upon the
soft cushion, and after much stroking and
tucking up, she stole away on tip-toe to her
mother's side.</p>

<p>But Pussy was in a playful mood, and as
soon as the little girl's back was turned she
sprang lightly out of her bed and went
scampering gaily round the room.</p>

<p>"Naughty, naughty puss!" cried Bunny
laughing, and off she went in pursuit of the
runaway.</p>

<p>"Bunny, dear Bunny, I can't bear that
noise," cried Mrs. Dashwood, as her little
daughter tumbled over a footstool and knocked
down a chair. "I can't bear it indeed, dear
child, so I think you had better go out.
Sophie will take you for a walk, as I want
Miss Kerr to read to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, mama! I like Miss Kerr much
better than Sophie," cried Bunny, "and so
does Mervyn. Do let Miss Kerr come."</p>

<p>"But, Bunny, dear," said Miss Kerr, "you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
would not like poor mama to have no one
to read to her, would you? It is so dull for
her all day on the sofa by herself. You
would not ask me to leave her, would you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no, dear, darling mama, I will
not ask Miss Kerr to come, not for a minute!"
cried Bunny as, kneeling beside the sofa, she
threw her arms round her mother's neck and
kissed her vehemently. "I could not bear
to think of you being lonely, mamey dear.
But do let us stay here now, and go out in
the afternoon with Miss Kerr. Mervyn can't
bear Sophie."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that, my little man," said
Mrs. Dashwood, drawing the boy towards
her; "Sophie is sharp and quick, but she is
very good-natured, I think, so I hope you
will try and like her."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, aunt," answered Mervyn, flushing,
"I only meant that I would rather have
my own dear nurse, and that I was very
sorry she had been sent away to India again."</p>

<p>"She was not sent away, dear," answered
Mrs. Dashwood; "she went by her own
wish. She was fond of you, Mervyn, but
she did not like to live in England, so she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
hurried back to India as soon as she could.
It will be better for you to learn English
well, and try to pick up a little French from
Sophie, than to be always talking with an
Indian, my child. But the first thing you
have to do, Mervyn, is to get fat and rosy
like Bunny here. And you must grow tall,
dear boy, for you are very, very small for
your age; you must grow as fast as you can
or this little girl will soon be the tallest,"
and Mrs. Dashwood pinched her daughter's
plump cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh! but mama, dear, he can't make himself
grow," remarked Bunny, as she stood up
to measure herself with her cousin. "He
has not got a key to wind up the works of
himself, so he must just wait small till he
begins to grow big."</p>

<p>"You are sharp enough, Miss Pert," said
her mother, laughing. "I wish you would
learn to be more steady and to remember
what is said to you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can remember," cried Bunny gaily;
"I've got a splendid memory, haven't I, Miss
Kerr?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you have, dear," said Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Kerr gravely; "but I am afraid you do not
always remember at the right time. Eh!
Bunny?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said the little girl, hanging
her head; "I quite forgot when I got up and
went to feed Frisk. But I don't think God
minded that much; it was not much harm."</p>

<p>"God is always displeased at disobedience,
Bunny," said Mrs. Dashwood very seriously.
"The first thing God expects of a little child
is that she should be obedient, and so my
Bunny must try and remember things that
she is not allowed to do, and then be very
careful not to do them."</p>

<p>"Yes, mama, I will try," said Bunny in a
subdued voice.</p>

<p>"That is right, dear, and I hope little
Mervyn will do the same."</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt, I will indeed; papa told me
to be very good until he came home, and I
mean to be," he said, drawing himself up in
a determined manner.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I am sure you will do Bunny
good and help her to remember. But
now run away like good children and tell
Sophie to take you out for a walk. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
lovely morning, and a run on the sands will
give you an appetite for your dinner."</p>

<p>"Very well, mama," cried Bunny gaily,
and away she darted out of the room singing
and shouting at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>"Good morning, aunt," said Mervyn gently,
and he followed his little cousin in a slow
dignified manner, turning quietly to shut the
drawing-room door behind him.</p>

<p>"What a harum-scarum that Bunny is!"
said Mrs. Dashwood with a sigh. "It is very
hard to make an impression on her."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is certainly, at least for more than
a few minutes at a time," answered Miss
Kerr; "she is always so ready to be good, no
matter what she has done, that it is not
easy to scold her much. But she is a good-hearted
child, and I am sure in a short time
you will see a great change in her."</p>

<p>"I hope so, indeed," said Mrs. Dashwood,
"for she is a constant worry at present and
extremely hard to manage."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ut</span> of the gate and down the road
went the two little cousins hand in
hand, whilst close behind them
walked Sophie, holding up a big
umbrella, and carrying a yellow-covered
novel under her arm.</p>

<p>On they went; the little ones laughing and
talking pleasantly together, until they came
to the entrance of the Spa, a gay promenade
which the fashionables of the place were in
the habit of frequenting in the morning to
inhale the sea breezes, listen to sweet music
and meet their friends.</p>

<p>Sophie liked the Spa, for there she saw
much to delight and amuse her, whilst on the
sands she always felt dull and weary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>But Bunny's ideas and those of her maid
were not at all the same, for the little girl
loved the sands, and could spend hours there
digging and building castles of all shapes and
sizes. Every day there was an angry dispute
between the nurse and child as to where
they should spend their time between breakfast
and dinner; sometimes one came off victorious
and sometimes the other. This morning,
as usual, Bunny was quite determined to
go on the sands, and Sophie was equally resolved
to go down to the Spa.</p>

<p>"Mama said we were to go on the sands,
Sophie, and I hate that old Spa," cried Bunny,
making a rush towards the steps that led
down to the sands; "I've got my spade, and
so has Mervyn, and it's very unkind of you
not to come there when it looks so nice and
we both want to go."</p>

<p>"You'll just please to come where I tell
you, mademoiselle," said Sophie, making a
dive at the little girl, and dragging her
through the turnstile and on to the bridge
that led into the Cliff grounds.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you go to play any of
your bad tricks on me. It is enough difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
minding two of you in here without running
all over the sands for you."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Bunny," said Mervyn gently,
as they walked along together, "Miss Kerr
will come on the sands with us after dinner,
perhaps, and then we will have fine fun."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," answered the little girl with
a toss of her head, and speaking in a loud
voice so that the maid might hear her; "Miss
Kerr always does what I ask her to do, but
Sophie is a regular cross-patch."</p>

<p>"Sit down here, mademoiselle, and try to
behave like a lady," cried Sophie, as she
seated herself upon a bench at the top of the
cliff, overlooking the promenade and sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to sit down, I want to
walk," cried Bunny tearfully; "why, we have
just come out."</p>

<p>"Of course you want to do exactly what
I tell you not to do," said Sophie angrily;
"sit down, both of you, when I tell you," and
she lifted first one and then the other, and
placed them very roughly upon the bench.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a friend of Sophie's
approached them, and after some pressing
she took a seat beside the maid, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
children were pushed away by themselves to
the other end of the bench.</p>

<p>"How long an age it is since I've seen you,
Kitty!" cried Sophie, smiling pleasantly upon
the new-comer.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a long time," answered her
friend, "and I've lots of news for you. I've
heard of a place&mdash;but it might be dangerous
to say much just now," and she glanced at
the children.</p>

<p>"Oh, they will not pay attention," cried
Sophie, "but it's easy to get rid of them if
you like. Meess Bunny, you can run and play
up and down for a little with your cousin.
But do not go very far."</p>

<p>"That is nice!" exclaimed Bunny gaily;
"thank you, Sophie, very much," and jumping
off the seat, she took Mervyn by the hand and
dragged him away for a race down the hill.</p>

<p>"What is that, Bunny? What is that?"
cried Mervyn suddenly, and he pointed his
finger towards the far end of the Spa. "It's
like a train, at least one carriage of a train,
and it's running so fast up the side of the
cliff, and, oh dear! I declare there is another
one just the same coming down past it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>"That is the lift, Mervyn; doesn't it look
very funny hanging all down like that? Do
you know, I went in it once with papa and it
was lovely. It went along so smooth and so
fast."</p>

<p>"I would like so much to go in it," said
Mervyn, "I wonder if uncle will take me
some day."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure he will, and me too," cried
Bunny, skipping gaily along. "But I tell you
what, Mervyn, wouldn't it be fun to go off
now, all by ourselves."</p>

<p>"Now!" exclaimed Mervyn in surprise,
"and what would Sophie say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she will never know," said Bunny.
"We'll go up in the lift and run down those
paths among the trees ever so fast, and get
back to her before she knows we have gone
away at all. She always has so much to say
to that friend of hers."</p>

<p>"Yes, but don't you have to pay to go up
in the lift?" asked Mervyn, "and I have no
money. Have you?"</p>

<p>"Of course we must pay, but it's only a
penny each, I know," answered Bunny, "and
I have got twopence in my pocket that papa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
gave me this morning. I was going to give
it to Miss Kerr, but I won't now."</p>

<p>"To Miss Kerr! Why should you give her
your money?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a secret of mine. But I don't
mind telling you, Mervyn, only you must not
tell anyone, will you now? Promise you
won't, like a good boy."</p>

<p>"I promise," answered Mervyn earnestly;
"I would not tell anyone for the world."</p>

<p>"Well, one day Miss Kerr lent me three
pennies to give to a poor boy, and I said I
would pay her back very soon."</p>

<p>"Then I would not spend the pennies," said
Mervyn decidedly; "keep them, Bunny, and
give them to Miss Kerr when we go home."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I would much rather go in the lift,"
cried Bunny. "Miss Kerr won't mind, for
she said I need not be in a hurry to pay it."</p>

<p>"Still I think it would be better," began
Mervyn solemnly, "to pay Miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother! Never mind thinking, but
come along, or we will not have time to go
up in the lift before Sophie wants to go home
for her dinner."</p>

<p>"I should like to go up in it very much,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
said Mervyn weakly, and casting longing
looks at the distant lift, "but, indeed,
Bunny&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are silly!" cried the little girl.
"Come on quick or we sha'n't have time,"
and grasping his hand, she hurried him down
the steps, with just one backward glance to
make sure that Sophie was still safe upon
her bench. The maid's face was turned
away towards her friend, who seemed to be
telling a very interesting story; they were
both completely occupied and quite unaware
of what was going on about them.</p>

<p>"We shall have plenty of time!" said
Bunny growing bold at the sight of the back
of Sophie's head. "So come along, Mervyn,
and see what the lift is like."</p>

<p>There was a great crowd of ladies and
gentlemen walking up and down the promenade,
and it took the children a long time
to make their way as far as the band-stand,
and even then they were at some distance
from the wonderful lift that had attracted
the little stranger so much.</p>

<p>As they hurried along, pushing their way
right and left through the people, the band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
began to play the "Blue Danube Waltzes,"
and Mervyn stopped short in delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely waltz!" he cried.
"Bunny dear, do let us stay here and listen
to it. I'd much rather hear the music than
go up in the lift, I would, indeed."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no," cried Bunny, "I'm tired of
that old band, it's a stupid old thing! We
can come and listen to it to-morrow if you
like; but do come on now, you can't think
how nice it is flying up the cliff in the lift;
besides, I am quite sure that we sha'n't get a
chance to go another day."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, if you want to go so much;
but really, Bunny, I would far rather stay
and hear the music," said Mervyn, "I would
indeed."</p>

<p>"Bother the music! Do come, like a good
boy," cried the little girl impatiently, and
catching him by the hand she dragged him
away through the gate that led to the lift.</p>

<p>There was a great crowd of people of all
kinds waiting to go up in the lift, for it was
getting near luncheon hour at the hotels, and
many were anxious to be in good time for
that pleasant meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Our little friends, Bunny and Mervyn,
were so small that they were a good deal
knocked about by the crowd, and the lift
went off several times before they managed
to push themselves anywhere near the front.
At last the conductor noticed the two mites,
and stepping forward in a kindly way, he
took them by the hand, helped them into
the carriage, and seating them side by side,
remarked with a smile:</p>

<p>"You're a funny pair to be sure! Where
is your nurse?"</p>

<p>"She's on the Spa, at least on a bench
just at the top of the steps," said Bunny
gaily as she arranged her short skirts about
her on the seat. "My cousin is a stranger
here, so I have brought him to see what the
lift is like."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the man with a laugh.
"What a kind little lady you are to be sure;"
and then, as the carriage was full, he banged
the door and away they went.</p>

<p>"Isn't it nice, Mervyn? Aren't you glad
I brought you?" asked Bunny in a patronizing
tone. "It is much nicer in here than
sitting up on that bench. Isn't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>"Yes, I suppose it is," answered Mervyn
doubtfully, "but oh, Bunny, I don't much
like it! I have a sort of feeling as if I were
in a ship, and it makes me giddy to look out&mdash;indeed
it does."</p>

<p>"Don't look out then," said Bunny decisively.
"But really, Mervyn, I think it's
lovely&mdash;it's so&mdash;Oh, dear what is that?" she
cried in alarm, as with a harsh grating noise
the lift they were in, came to a sudden stand-still,
and the descending one shot quickly
past them.</p>

<p>"Something gone wrong, I expect," grumbled
an old gentleman beside her; "ah, they
have to let us go down again! What an
awful nuisance!"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, sir, is there going to be an
accident?" cried Bunny in a voice of terror,
and growing very pale. "My cousin is just
come from India, and I am sure he will be
frightened," and she put her little arm round
Mervyn as if to protect him from danger.</p>

<p>"No, no, there is not going to be any
accident, my little girl," answered the old
gentleman with a kind smile. "Don't be
afraid, we'll go up again in a minute; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
must say the small cousin from India doesn't
look half so much frightened as you do,"
and he patted her on the back. "There,
now, off we go, you see, and we'll be at the
top in a minute."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad we are out of that horrid
thing! and, Bunny, I am sure we should
never have gone into it," cried Mervyn, as
they at last stepped out of the lift and ran
quickly along the cliff towards the entrance
to the Spa grounds. "Just think, there
might have been an accident and we might
have been killed! Oh, it would have been
so dreadful if such a thing had happened."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would," answered Bunny, "and
Sophie will be angry, for we have been away
such a long time. And oh, Mervyn, now I
remember, mama told me that I should never
leave my nurse when I was out with her,
and I quite forgot, and there, I have been
disobedient again! I am so sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bunny, Bunny! why don't you try
and remember?" cried Mervyn reproachfully,
"and we promised aunt to be so good just
before we came out," and tears of sorrow
stood in the little boy's eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, Mervyn, dear," said Bunny
kissing him, "it was my fault. Don't cry&mdash;you
were not naughty at all. It was all
because I forgot again. Oh, dear, I am afraid
Miss Kerr will be angry with me. But come
along quick, there is Sophie. See, she is
looking about everywhere for us."</p>

<p>The two children trotted along at a brisk
pace down the steep winding path that led
through the pretty ornamental grounds with
which the cliff, overhanging the Spa, was tastefully
laid out. The trees were high and shady,
so the little creatures were not visible from
below as they ran quickly on their way. But
soon they came to a part where there was
not even a bush to hide them from view,
and as Sophie walked up and down in despair,
her eyes wandering about wildly in
every direction, she suddenly caught sight of
Bunny's white hat and blue sash, and with a
shriek of rage, she bounded up the path, and
taking hold of them by the shoulders shook
them angrily as she cried in a hoarse voice:</p>

<p>"Ah, you wicked bad ones, I thought you
were lost! I thought the kidnappers had
taken you away for ever."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>"Oh, we are too big for that!" cried Bunny,
"and you need not be in such a rage, Sophie,
we only went up in the lift, as Mervyn
wanted to see what it was like;" and she
walked past the maid with a scornful toss of
her little head.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Sophie, indeed I am,"
said Mervyn gently; "I did not know we
had so far to go. I am sorry you thought
we were lost."</p>

<p>"Ah! much I care whether you are sorry
or not," cried the angry maid. "It will be
like Mademoiselle Bunny's sorrow&mdash;it will
last one minute&mdash;and then off to some more
naughty things," and with a push and a slap
Sophie drove the two children on before her,
over the bridge and away home to Holly
Lodge.</p>

<p>"And now," she cried as they reached the
hall door, "I will march you both up to Miss
Kerr, and see what she will do with you.
Some punishment should be given to you,
and I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well!" said Bunny, "we'll go
and tell Miss Kerr ourselves. You need not
come with us, we don't want you at all. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
along, Mervyn;" and taking the little boy by
the hand, she dragged him up the stairs after
her.</p>

<h3>IN MISS KERR'S ROOM.</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap7_w.jpg" title="W" height="200" width="133" alt="W" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">hen</span> the two children reached
Miss Kerr's bed-room, they found
the door shut, and feeling quite
certain that she was there, they
knocked gently, and then stood
very still upon the mat, expecting every
moment to hear her voice calling to them to
go in.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Kerr," said Bunny at last, as,
growing impatient at the delay, she put her
little mouth to the key-hole and tried very
hard to make herself heard within the room,
"Mervyn and I want to tell you something,
so please, please, open the door and let us
in."</p>

<p>But to her surprise she received no answer,
and becoming more and more cross and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
impatient, she rattled the handle as noisily
as possible in order to attract Miss Kerr's
attention.</p>

<p>"I can't make out why she doesn't speak
to us," said Mervyn in a whisper. "I think
she must be asleep."</p>

<p>"Asleep!" exclaimed Bunny indignantly.
"She isn't a baby, and she isn't ill, so why
should she be asleep at this time of the
day?"</p>

<p>"Well, in India people sleep in the day
when they're not a bit ill, just because it's
hot&mdash;so why shouldn't they here?"</p>

<p>"What a lot of sillies they must be in
India then!" cried Bunny contemptuously.
"Why, I have not been asleep in the day for
years&mdash;not since I was quite small," and she
rattled away more noisily than ever at the
door-handle.</p>

<p>"Miss Kerr is not there, children," said a
housemaid who passed along the passage at
that moment, "she has been in the drawing-room
all the morning."</p>

<p>"Has she?" said Bunny, "oh, then, I tell
you what, Mervyn, we'll just go in and wait
for her. She will be sure to come up in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
minutes to wash her hands before dinner,
and then we'll tell her."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there is Sophie calling to us to
get ready ourselves. She will be awfully
angry if we don't go," said Mervyn. "Listen
how she is screaming."</p>

<p>"Never mind her, the nasty, cross old thing!"
cried Bunny, opening the bed-room door.
"Come in, Mervyn, come in! There is Sophie&mdash;do
be quick, or she will catch us and drag
us off with her&mdash;and then she'll tell Miss
Kerr before we do. Come in, come in," and
once more she hurried her cousin along with
her, against his own will and inclination.</p>

<p>"But, Bunny, I do think we ought to go to
Sophie, I do indeed," said Mervyn; "listen,
she is asking the housemaid if she has seen
us anywhere. And oh, she is coming here to
look for us&mdash;she will be awfully cross! Do
let us go into the nursery quietly and take
off our things and get ready for dinner."</p>

<p>"Well, you are a silly, Mervyn! That
would spoil all the fun. But I know what
I'll do&mdash;I'll lock the door, and then Sophie
will not be able to get us. I can easily open
it for Miss Kerr when she comes up," cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Bunny; and before Mervyn could say a word
to prevent her, the little girl turned the key
in the lock, and, clapping her hands with delight,
danced up and down the room singing
at the top of her voice:</p>

<div class="block2" style="width: 400px;">
<p>"What a good plan! What a good plan!<br />
And the dinner is in the frying pan!"</p>
</div>

<p>"Indeed, then I wish it was here," grumbled
Mervyn, "I'm awfully hungry, and it
would be much better to go down to dinner
now, and tell Miss Kerr afterwards, or at
dinner-time, Bunny, indeed it would."</p>

<p>"Yes, and let Sophie hear her scolding us,"
cried the little girl. "I am hungry too, I can
tell you, Mervyn; but Miss Kerr won't be
long, I am sure. Hasn't she got a pretty
room? and doesn't the sea and the bridge
look nice from the window?"</p>

<p>"Well enough," answered Mervyn crossly,
as he rolled about in an arm-chair that stood
away in the furthest corner. "But oh, it is
silly to be sticking up here when the dinner
is ready down-stairs&mdash;oh, I smell it, and it
does smell nice! and I am so hungry, and it's
very stupid of you to keep me shut up here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I thought you were sorry and
wanted to tell Miss Kerr so," said Bunny
complacently, as she shook out her frock and
admired herself in the long glass. "It's very
greedy to talk so much about your dinner."</p>

<p>"Is it?" grumbled Mervyn. "Well, I
don't care! I'm sure you're just as bad twisting
about and looking at yourself in the
glass, for that's being vain, and I'd rather be
greedy than vain, so I would, Bunny."</p>

<p>"Would you? Oh, that's because you're
a boy. Boys are greedy, but it's vulgar to be
greedy&mdash;Sophie says it is, but it's different
to be vain, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Bunny, come out this minute.
Ah, what a little naughty one you
are! and that cousin of yours he is a wicked
bad boy&mdash;he leads you into the mischiefs
of all kinds. Come out, I say, the dinner is
ready and Miss Kerr is waiting for you;" and
Sophie rattled the handle and hammered at
the door till the whole passage was filled
with the noise and the other servants came
running from all parts of the house to see
what could be the matter.</p>

<p>"What is wrong, Sophie?" asked Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Kerr, as she too hurried upstairs wondering
what was going on in the corridor. "Why
are you making such a dreadful noise?"</p>

<p>"Ah! ma foi! Noise, Miss Kerr! What can
I do but make a noise, when those two children
have locked themselves into your room,
and will not come out for their dinner. Is
it then a wonder that I make a noise?" and
she began once more to bang the door as if
she would like to break it in.</p>

<p>"That was Miss Kerr's voice, Bunny,"
whispered Mervyn; "do open the door and
let us go out to her now."</p>

<p>"Is it really? I only heard Sophie. Miss
Kerr," she called, "are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bunny, I am here. Come out, child,
come to your dinner. You must be starving,
both of you."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are," answered Bunny, "and we
will go out if you will send Sophie away.
Mervyn and I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>"Ah! what a naughty child!" cried Sophie.
"Meess Kerr, they have both been so very
difficult, so wicked! They have run away,
they have gone in the lift, they have just
escaped being seized by kidnappers and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>"That's a great story, Sophie," cried
Bunny through the door, "for there was
not a single kidnapper near us; was there,
Mervyn?"</p>

<p>"No, there wasn't," said Mervyn, "not one,
Sophie, there wasn't really."</p>

<p>"Now!" shouted Bunny triumphantly,
"you see you are quite wrong, Sophie."</p>

<p>"Open the door, Bunny, this minute," said
Miss Kerr decidedly, "I am surprised that
you should behave in such a naughty way,
just when I thought you were going to be a
good girl."</p>

<p>"I'll open it now, indeed I will," cried
Bunny, "and please, please don't be angry
with us. We are so sorry we ran away from
Sophie, indeed we are, and that is the reason
we came up here, just to tell you so."</p>

<p>All the time the child was talking she was
also working away at the key, trying her very
best to open the door. But no matter how
she turned or pulled it, round it would not
go, and at last, hot and tired with so many
violent efforts, she begged Mervyn to try if
he could make it turn.</p>

<p>"No, Bunny, I can't," said the boy sadly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
after working patiently at the key for some
time. "It's no use, I can't do it at all."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!" cried Bunny in a
miserable voice, "what shall we do? Miss
Kerr, dear, we can't open the door, it's locked
quite fast."</p>

<p>"Take the key out of the lock and push
it under the door, and I will try and open it
from this side," said Miss Kerr; "it was
really very naughty of you to lock yourselves
up in such a way. But be quick and give
me the key."</p>

<p>After a good deal of pulling and tugging,
Bunny at last managed to get the key out of
the lock, and kneeling on the floor she tried
with all the strength of her tiny hands to
push it out under the door.</p>

<p>But the key was too large or the door
fitted too closely, and the little girl gave a
cry of alarm as she found that it was quite
impossible to get it out into the passage.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mervyn, dear, it won't go out! Oh!
Miss Kerr, what shall we do?" she cried,
bursting into tears; "if we can't open the
door what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"And I am so hungry," said Mervyn in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
doleful tone. "How nasty it will be to be
stuck in here for ever! Oh, pray open the
door! Oh! pray open the door, Miss Kerr."</p>

<p>"Throw the key out of the window,
Bunny," said Miss Kerr, "and I will go
round and pick it up, and let you out in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Oh! the window is shut. The window
is shut," cried the two children in despair,
"and we cannot reach to open it. What shall
we do? What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Miss Kerr,
"who can have shut the window?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say I did, miss," said the
housemaid. "The wind was so strong upon the
window that was open, that I shut it, intending
to open the middle one, but I forgot all about
it when I was leaving the room."</p>

<p>"It is extremely awkward, and has helped
to give the poor children a great fright," said
Miss Kerr. "Go and bring me the keys of all
the doors, Sarah, and I will try if any of them
will fit the lock. Don't be uneasy, Bunny;
don't cry, little Mervyn. We will get you
out some way or other, you may be quite
sure, so don't be afraid. I have sent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
some keys to try if they will open the door,
so don't fret. Ah! here they are."</p>

<p>One after the other the keys were taken
and tried, but not one was of the slightest
use. One was too large, and another too
small, and Miss Kerr felt really grieved for
the poor little prisoners, whose sobs were
distinctly heard through the door.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" she said. "It is really
very hard on them to be shut in there for
such a long, long time! And they are so
hungry too."</p>

<p>"Send for a man to pick the lock, miss,"
said Sarah. "Ashton will get some one from
one of the shops."</p>

<p>"But that will take such a time!" cried
Miss Kerr; "it is a long way to the town, and
the children want their dinner so badly. No,
I must think of some quicker plan than that.
Ah, now I know one!" she exclaimed with a
sudden smile; "it is a pity, but it can't be
helped! Bunny, dear, will you take the
poker, break a pane of glass with it, and
throw the key out upon the grass. Be very
careful not to cut your fingers."</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" cried Mervyn, jumping up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
out of the chair, where he had been rolling
about disconsolately. "I'd just like to break
a window, and I'm taller than you, Bunny;
do let me, like a good girl."</p>

<p>"No, no; Miss Kerr told me to do it,"
cried Bunny, "and I should like to break a
pane too;" and seizing the poker she sent it
crash through the glass.</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun! What a rare smash!" exclaimed
Mervyn in delight. "I will throw
the key out;" and he darted across the room,
picked up the key, and flung it with all his
strength at the window.</p>

<p>But he did not aim straight, and instead
of flying into the garden the key merely
shattered the glass a little more, and fell back
again on to the floor.</p>

<p>"You stupid boy! What a bad shot!"
cried Bunny, and taking it up between her
finger and thumb she stepped on a chair, and
dropped it down cleverly upon the grass, just
at Miss Kerr's feet.</p>

<p>"That is right," said the governess with a
smile, as she stooped to pick up the key;
"and now don't you think it would be a good
punishment for all your naughtiness to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
you both locked up there for the rest of the
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, pray do not do that, Miss
Kerr, we are so sorry and so hungry!" and
the two little faces, as they were pressed
against the window, looked so utterly miserable
and woebegone, that the kind-hearted
governess could not bear to carry out her
threat of punishment, but hurried away as
fast as possible to let the poor children out.</p>

<p>When the door was at last opened and
they were told to come forth, Mervyn hung
back and did not dare to raise his eyes to
Miss Kerr's face. Bunny, on the contrary,
greeted her with a cry of joy, and springing
into her arms, kissed her heartily over and
over again.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to get out! I'm so glad to
get out! Oh, I was afraid we should have to
stay in here all day by ourselves."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope this will be a lesson to you
never to shut yourself into a room again,
Bunny," said Miss Kerr severely. "It was
a very foolish thing to do, and I cannot
say that I am very sorry that you got a
little fright, for I really think you deserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to suffer something for your naughtiness.
But tell me, little man," she said to Mervyn,
"are you not glad to get out too? You don't
look so cheerful over it as Bunny does."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to get out. But I&mdash;I&mdash;wanted
to tell you," he said with much difficulty,
and clasping his little hands tightly
together. "I want&mdash;to tell you&mdash;that I am
very sorry I was disobedient and ran away
from Sophie."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say you are sorry,
dear," answered Miss Kerr. "I am sure you
mean it Mervyn, and that I may trust you
not to be disobedient again."</p>

<p>"Yes, you may trust me, indeed you may,"
the boy cried with a bright smile, "I will
really try to be good, and make Bunny remember
if I can."</p>

<p>"Naughty little Bun! Why do you always
forget as you do?" said Miss Kerr
gently. "I did think you were going to be
good to-day, and just see how you have disappointed
me!"</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," murmured Bunny, hanging
her head. "I did want to be good, and I
promise you I won't be naughty again. I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
always stay as close up to Sophie as ever I
can when we go out, I will indeed."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I will not say any more
about the matter. Run away now, like good
children, and get ready for dinner. And
Bunny, dear, if Sophie is a little cross, be
gentle and polite with her, for you have tormented
and tried her temper very much, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will be ever so nice and kind to
her, dear, dear Miss Kerr," cried Bunny as
she gave the governess a bear-like hug and
another loving kiss. "I'll be awfully polite;"
and laughing merrily she jumped off her
perch on Miss Kerr's knee, and ran down the
passage to the nursery, waving her hat and
singing at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>"Poor little giddy-pate!" said Miss Kerr
with a sigh. "I wonder how long she will
keep all those splendid promises. But why
don't you go off and get ready for dinner too,
Mervyn?" she asked in surprise as she saw the
little boy lingering at the door in a shy
uncertain manner. "Run along, dear, at
once."</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;give me a kiss?" said Mervyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
with a deep blush. "I want to know that you
have really forgiven me."</p>

<p>"Of course I have, dear boy," answered
Miss Kerr, and she put her arm round him
and kissed him affectionately. "I have
quite forgiven you, Mervyn, and I feel sure
that you are going to be a very good boy."</p>

<p>"I am going to try very hard to be good,"
replied the boy solemnly, "and as Bunny is
so small perhaps I may make her do the
same."</p>

<p>"Very likely, Mervyn, dear, for good example
is sure to have a strong effect upon
little Bunny, who is more thoughtless than
really naughty. But run off now, dear,
and get your hands washed as quickly as
possible. The dinner will not be fit to eat
if we keep it waiting any longer."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Mervyn with a bright
happy smile. "We have kept it waiting a
dreadfully long time, and we are all just
dying with hunger, I'm sure;" and he too
went off singing to the nursery.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap8_f.jpg" title="F" height="200" width="100" alt="F" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">or</span> some time after this there was
a marked improvement in little
Bunny's behaviour, and everyone
in the house was delighted with
the change, and rejoiced over it in
a very open manner.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly wonderful!" said Mrs.
Dashwood; "our little troublesome is becoming
quite a well-behaved young person.
I feel very grateful to you, Miss Kerr, for
I believe it is all owing to your tender care
and kind good-nature that the child is improving
so much."</p>

<p>"I don't think I have so much to do with
the change as little Mervyn," answered Miss
Kerr with a smile. "I have lectured poor
Bunny very often, it is true, but I think a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
good obedient little friend does a child more
real good than all the scoldings and lectures
in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay it is an excellent thing,"
replied Mrs. Dashwood; "but still I think
your lectures and sermons have improved
my poor darling a great deal. She was very
ignorant when you came to look after her."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was," said Miss Kerr; "she did
not know much, poor child, and what was
worse, did not care to learn anything. But
lately she has begun to get on very nicely.
And there, again, you see it is Mervyn who
has done her good, for her whole ambition
is to do everything better than he does it."</p>

<p>"The little rogue!" exclaimed Mrs. Dashwood
laughing. "Well, it is a good thing
to have found a way to make her work.
Where is she now, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Dashwood took her off with him to
the stables. Mervyn went too, as it seems
there is a pleasant surprise awaiting them
there. They both went off laden with bread
for Frisk."</p>

<p>"I think I can guess what the surprise is,"
said Mrs. Dashwood with a smile; "I&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>"Oh, mama, mama! we are glad! we are
glad!" cried Bunny bursting suddenly into
the room, followed by Mervyn with a radiant
look of happiness on his little white face.
"What do you think? Guess what has
happened. Just guess what papa has given
Mervyn."</p>

<p>"Dear aunt, it was so kind of uncle to buy
me such a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let her guess&mdash;let her guess, Mervyn.
Don't tell her what he bought you. Miss
Kerr, what did papa buy for him? Something
living, something with a tail, something
with a nose, a dear velvety nose and
a soft silky coat," cried Bunny, as she danced
up and down the drawing-room in high
glee.</p>

<p>"A kitten," said Miss Kerr gravely.</p>

<p>"A kitten! oh, the idea!" exclaimed
Bunny, "as if people bought kittens."</p>

<p>"Something far nicer!" said Mervyn in a
voice full of pleasure. "I'll tell her, Bunny,
something to ride&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, don't tell, don't tell!" cried the
little girl, laying her hand quickly over his
mouth. "Mama, guess, guess."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>"A pony, Bun, a little brown pony," said
Mrs. Dashwood, smiling brightly upon the
eager excited children.</p>

<p>"You dear clever mamey, that's just what
it is," exclaimed Bunny, giving her mother
an affectionate hug. "And Mervyn's so
pleased, and I am so glad, and oh, it will
be so nice going out to ride together!" and
jumping up sideways on the arm of the sofa
the little girl began to work herself about as
if she were really on Frisk's back and trotting
along a country road.</p>

<p>"My dear Bunny, please don't," cried Mrs.
Dashwood, as she felt the sofa upon which
she was lying, shaken up and down by the
child's vigorous antics. "Please don't, dear,
you hurt me very much."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry!" cried Bunny bounding
quickly down from her perch, and holding
her face up for a pardoning kiss. "But
won't it be nice, mama? Frisk is so glad to
have a friend in the stable with him, and it
will be fun for me to have Mervyn to ride
with."</p>

<p>"Yes, it will be very nice, dear. But,
Bunny, you talk so much that Mervyn never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
gets saying a word. Tell me, my dear, do
you really like your pony?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, aunt, I am delighted with him,
he is so pretty. It was very good of uncle
to buy him for me."</p>

<p>"And you will not be afraid to ride him, I
hope," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, I think not, at least not if we go
along quietly. But Bunny says she will
make Frisk go awfully fast, and then my
pony will run after him, and that she is
sure I shall be frightened and hold on by the
mane and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bunny, Bunny, you must not say such
naughty things," cried Mrs. Dashwood shaking
her finger at the mischievous child.
"But don't mind her, Mervyn. She does
not ride at all so splendidly herself. The
groom or her papa always holds Frisk by a
leading rein, so it would be quite impossible
for her to go on as fast as she likes; so do not
mind her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't feel a bit afraid if some one
holds my pony by a rein," said Mervyn
bravely; "not one bit; I think it will be lovely
riding along together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>"That is right," said Mrs. Dashwood. "I
am sure you will be a clever horseman, for
your papa was when he was a boy."</p>

<p>"And so he is now, aunt. He has a beautiful
horse, and he looks splendid on it when
he goes off to ride," cried Mervyn, smiling
brightly at the recollection; "I used to think
he looked grander than any of the other
officers."</p>

<p>"Poor little man," said his aunt gently, as
she smoothed back the hair from his brow.
"You are very fond of your papa, Mervyn,
and do you know, I think you will be like
him when you grow big and strong."</p>

<p>"I want to be like him in every way," said
Mervyn, "and I mean to be an officer when
I grow up."</p>

<p>"And go away to that nasty, hot India,"
cried Bunny; "oh, I'd be so lonely if you
went away again&mdash;please don't, Mervyn,
please don't."</p>

<p>"What is Mervyn not to do, my little
woman?" asked Mr. Dashwood, who entered
the room at this moment.</p>

<p>"He's not to go back to India again,
because I should be so lonely without him,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
cried Bunny catching hold of her papa's hand
and laying her little cheek against it; "you
won't let him go, papa, will you, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I couldn't think of such a
thing. But I am sure he won't want to go
when he hears that his papa is coming home
for Christmas; eh, my boy?"</p>

<p>"That is good news, uncle," cried Mervyn
joyfully; "I never thought he would come so
soon. Not much fear of my wanting to go to
India when he comes home."</p>

<p>"So I thought," said Mr. Dashwood. "And
now, children, when are we to have our first
ride?"</p>

<p>"Now, now; to-day, to-day," cried Bunny;
"dear papa, let us go off at once!"</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear. I thought you
would like to go soon, so I told John to get
the ponies and horses ready in half an hour.
You had better run and get on your habit&mdash;that
is, if Miss Kerr will let you both off
with your afternoon lessons. What do you
think, Miss Kerr, do they deserve a ride?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they do, for they have both
been very good," answered the governess with
a smile; "besides, I really don't think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
look studiously inclined&mdash;they are very much
excited."</p>

<p>"I couldn't learn a lesson if I tried ever
so," cried Bunny, "I really couldn't, so I am
glad you are going to let us off. Good-bye,
Miss Kerr; good-bye, mama I sha'n't be
long, papa, dear;" and away she flew in
breathless haste to the nursery.</p>

<p>Sophie had received a message informing
her that her young lady was going out for a
ride, and when Bunny went up to be dressed
she found her pretty brown habit and neat
felt hat laid all ready for her on the bed.</p>

<p>"That is a dear good Sophie," she cried,
and she was in such good humour that she
allowed the maid to brush her hair and put
on her habit without uttering a single cross
word or complaint.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, that will do
nicely," she said politely, as Sophie put the
last finishing touch to her curls; then taking
her little whip with the pretty silver top
from the maid's hand, she gathered up her
skirts and ran quickly down to the hall-door.</p>

<p>"What a pleasure it is to dress her when
she is so good and polite as that!" said Sophie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to herself as she watched the little figure
running away from her down the passage.
"What a pity it is that children are so often
naughty and troublesome!"</p>

<p>When Bunny arrived in the hall she found
her papa and Mervyn quite ready to start for
their ride.</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice Brownie looks!" cried the
little girl in delight, as her cousin was
lifted on to his new pony; "but I don't think
he is as handsome as you, old Frisk. Is he,
papa?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure, dear," answered
her papa, laughing; "but I suppose you like
Frisk best because he is your own."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I do," said Bunny, and
placing her little foot on her papa's hand she
sprang nimbly to her saddle. "Good-bye,
Miss Kerr, good-bye."</p>

<p>Mr. Dashwood mounted his horse, the
groom jumped on his, and the whole party
rode gaily up the avenue and out of the gate.</p>

<p>"I declare Mervyn sits very well, papa,"
said Bunny in a patronizing manner, as she
looked back at her cousin, who was following
them with the servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>"Yes, of course he sits well; why shouldn't
he?" asked Mr. Dashwood; "he wants a few
lessons and then he will ride very well, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay," said Bunny; "but he
never rode before, you know, except just little
short rides on Frisk, and he'd be awfully
afraid to go without the leading rein, I
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, and quite right too," said her father;
"it's only children who ride very well who
should be allowed to go without a leading
rein, and especially on a country road.
Supposing the pony took it into his head to
bolt&mdash;what do you think would happen
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he could be pulled up quite tight by
his rein. I wouldn't be a bit afraid to ride
all by myself."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you, indeed, Miss Vanity. Well,
I would rather not trust you," said Mr. Dashwood
laughing; "I think it is very likely you
would find Master Frisk rather too much for
you without a leading rein, my dear child."</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't," answered Bunny, bending
over her pony and patting his neck; "Frisk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and I are such friends he would be sure to do
what I told him. Wouldn't you, Friskie?"</p>

<p>"Don't trust him or your own power too
much, Miss Bunny," replied her father with
a smile. "But who is that coming down the
road towards us? I think I ought to know
him."</p>

<p>"Why, papa, it's Mr. Davis, that nice old
gentleman who gave me the box of sweets;
don't you remember? I'm sure it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it is," said Mr. Dashwood; "what
sharp eyes you have, little woman! You and
Mervyn had better ride on with John, as I
want to say a word to Mr. Davis."</p>

<p>"Very well, papa, but don't be long, pray,"
said the little girl; "it's so much nicer talking
to you than to John."</p>

<p>"No, I sha'n't be very long, dear. Good
morning, Mr. Davis," said Mr. Dashwood to
a tall fine-looking old gentleman who at this
moment rode up to them on a beautiful chestnut
horse; "I am very glad to see you. This
little girl of mine knew you a long way off."</p>

<p>"Ha! Miss Bunny and I are great friends,"
answered Mr. Davis with a smile, as he bent
forward to shake her warmly by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>"Those pretty eyes of yours are a deal sharper
than mine, my dear, for I had not the faintest
idea who it was that was coming along the
road. But I am glad I met you, Dashwood,
as I want to say a few words to you about&mdash;"
and he lowered his voice to a whisper.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Dashwood; "I'll
send these little people on with the groom,
and ride down the road a short way with you.
John," he called to the servant, "take Miss
Bunny's rein and go on up the hill with the
children, turn in at Lady Edith's Drive, and
I will overtake you in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the groom, touching his
hat respectfully, and riding forward he took
the rein from his master's hand.</p>

<p>"Ride quietly along and I will be back to
you very soon, Bunny," said Mr. Dashwood,
and then he turned his horse round and
walked it leisurely down the road again with
Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a pretty place!" cried Mervyn,
as the riding party trotted along through a
gate and into a cool shady avenue, with tall
stately trees growing closely together on
every side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>"This is Lady Edith's Drive," said Bunny;
"I think it is the prettiest place about Scarborough.
It is so cool and pleasant, and then
it is so quiet."</p>

<p>"Why is it called Lady Edith's Drive?"
asked Mervyn.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Bunny. "Do
you, John?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, Miss," said John; "I can't exactly
say as I do. I suppose some Lady Edith
used to drive here very often."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, indeed," said Bunny, laughing
merrily at this explanation.</p>

<p>"I don't think that tells us much, John,"
said Mervyn; "anyone might know that."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, very likely, sir," replied the
groom; "but I never asks no questions. If
I'm told a place is called by a name, I never
asks why or wherefore, but just takes it as the
name that it's to be called by."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you are very foolish then,"
said Mervyn; "I like asking questions, and
it's a very good way to learn about things, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>"I daresay it is, sir, for a young gentleman
like you, sir. But you see the people about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
me don't know no more nor I do, so what's the
use of asking them what's this an' what's that,
an' showin' them I don't know nothin' myself."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Mervyn,
"but I don't think it matters about showing
that you don't know. Miss Kerr says no one
should be ashamed to ask a question about a
thing they don't understand."</p>

<p>"John, John," cried Bunny suddenly as
she pulled very hard at the leading rein in
order to attract the groom's attention, "I
want to ask you something. Stoop down
that I may whisper it into your ear."</p>

<p>The man did as she requested; but when
he had heard what she wanted him to do he
shook his head in a very determined manner,
saying, "I couldn't on no account, Miss.
Your pa would be as angry as anything."</p>

<p>"No, he wouldn't, John. I told him I
could manage Frisk myself, and he only
laughed. Do let me&mdash;just for a few minutes.
I'll go along quite quietly, you'll see I will.
I want to show Mervyn that I can ride
better than he does, and that I am not afraid
to go without a leading rein."</p>

<p>"Well, it's very quiet here, so I suppose it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
could not be much harm," said the man,
yielding a little at her pleading voice; "I
really don't think it could be any harm;" and
he turned in his saddle and looked carefully
up and down the drive.</p>

<p>"Harm!" exclaimed Bunny, "of course it
could do no harm. Oh! pray take off the
rein, John," and she looked up into his face
in a most imploring manner.</p>

<p>"Well, you are a funny little lady, to be
sure," he answered with a good-natured
laugh, and, bending forward, he unfastened
the leading rein and put it into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Thank you, John," said the child, sitting
up proudly on her pony. "It feels ever so
much nicer without it; it's so silly to be
always led along by a rein like a baby.
Mervyn, I am riding all by myself. Wouldn't
you like to ride without a leading rein?" she
shouted across at her cousin, who was trotting
along quietly at the other side of the
groom; "it's twice as nice to feel that you
can go just as you like."</p>

<p>"I feel just as nice as I am, Bunny, thank
you," said Mervyn; "I would rather have
the rein, thank you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>"I can't hear what you say, so I think I'll
go round beside you, Mervyn," she cried
gaily; and, raising her whip, she brought it
down heavily upon poor Frisk's back, and
tried to make him go round beside Brownie.
But Frisk was not accustomed to such treatment,
and tossed his head and whisked up
his tail, but absolutely refused to go to the
other side of John's horse, no matter what
she did to him.</p>

<p>"You naughty pony," she cried, "you
must do what I tell you," and she tugged
violently at his mouth, and gave him another
sharp blow with her whip. This was more
than the pony could bear; and before his
little mistress knew where she was, he pricked
up his ears, and with an angry toss of his
head galloped away down the road as fast as
he could.</p>

<p>"Stop, Miss Bunny, for goodness sake
stop," shouted the groom; "you must not go
so fast; come back here at once."</p>

<h5 class="caption" style="padding-bottom: 2em;">FRANCIS SAVES BUNNY.</h5>

<p>"I can't stop&mdash;I can't!" shrieked the little
girl in a voice of terror. "Oh! he's running
away&mdash;he's running away;" and, completely
overcome with fright, poor Bunny dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
her reins, and, catching hold of the pony's
mane, held on to him with all her strength.</p>

<p>"What a fool I was to let her go!" cried
the groom; "what on earth will my master
say to me? Goodness, the silly child has
let go her reins; she'll be off&mdash;she'll be off;"
and, spurring up his horse, he rode after
the runaway, hoping to overtake him and
put a stop to his mad race.</p>

<p>But the noise of the horses as they clattered
down the road after him seemed only to
excite Master Frisk, and on he went faster
than ever.</p>

<p>As the pony reached the end of the drive,
and poor little Bunny had become so weak
and faint from terror that she was in great
danger of being thrown to the ground, a
young lad of about sixteen jumped up from
the grass where he had been seated, and,
dashing forward, seized Frisk by the head
and brought him to a sudden stand-still.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl," said the boy kindly, as
he lifted Bunny from her saddle and laid her
gently on the grass. "What a fright you
have had! How did this beggar come to
run away? He looks quiet enough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>"I whipped him," answered Bunny in a
shaky voice; "and oh! I thought I was going
to fall," and she put her hand to her head as
if she still felt giddy.</p>

<p>"You were certainly very nearly off," said
the boy; "but what a fool that groom of
yours was to let a kid like you ride without
a leading rein; he shouldn't have done such
a thing."</p>

<p>"Oh! but I begged him so hard that he
let me go," said Bunny; "he didn't want to
let me, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Bunny, I'm ashamed of you," cried
John, riding up beside her. "You promised
you'd ride quite quiet beside me, and you
broke your word. I'm very thankful to you,
sir, I'm sure," he continued, turning to the
young stranger. "In another minute this
little lady might have been thrown on her
head and been killed on the spot."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear! it wasn't my fault,"
cried Bunny, bursting into tears; "I only
mean't to go round beside Mervyn, and Frisk
ran away and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't cry, dear," said the strange lad
kindly; "you must not say another word to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
her, my man," he continued, turning to the
groom; "she is rather shaken with her fright,
and it's best to leave her alone. Take hold
of this pony and I will go and get your
young lady some fresh water; that will do
her good."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said John, pulling the
leading rein once more from his pocket, and
fastening it on to Frisk's bridle with an
angry jerk. "It's not my place to scold,
Miss Bunny, but a young lady should keep
her word, and not get a servant into trouble."</p>

<p>"But I didn't mean to break my word,
John, indeed I didn't," sobbed Bunny. "Oh!
why did papa leave us? oh, dear! oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"Drink this, you poor little mite," said her
new friend as he held a flask full of fresh
water to her lips. "It will do you ever so
much good. I will bathe your face for you,
and then you will see how comfortable you
will feel, but you must not cry any more."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," said Bunny, drinking
off the water; "it is very cool and nice."</p>

<p>"Yes," the boy answered, "it is very refreshing,
but this will do you more good,
I am sure;" and, removing her hat, he took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
neatly-folded, perfectly clean handkerchief
from his pocket, shook it out, and, dipping
it into the water, bathed the child's face as
tenderly as a girl might have done.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Bunny, as she
raised her big blue eyes to his face; "you are
a nice good boy," and she raised her face to
give him a kiss.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said smiling; "you are
beginning to look more cheerful," and, stooping,
he kissed her gently on the forehead.</p>

<p>At this moment the sound of horses' feet
was heard coming along the road, and Mr.
Dashwood soon appeared, riding quickly
towards them.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he cried in alarm,
as, drawing up sharply, he sprang from his
horse and rushed to his little girl's side.</p>

<p>"Oh! papa, papa!" cried the child, running
into her father's arms, "your poor Bunny
was nearly killed, only this nice boy stopped
Frisk and took me off his back."</p>

<p>"My poor darling!" cried Mr. Dashwood,
lifting her gently from the ground, and
smoothing back her ruffled hair, "I am very
thankful to God that you are not hurt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Thank you, too, my lad, for your kind and
ready assistance," he said to the young
stranger, grasping him warmly by the hand,
"and now tell me, sir," he cried with a stern
look, as he turned to the groom, "how it is
that the child whom I left in your care came
to be in such danger."</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, Miss Bunny asked&mdash;"
began John very nervously.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, I&mdash;it was all my fault," interrupted
the little girl; "don't scold John. I
wanted to show Mervyn that I could ride
better than he does, and as I could not do so
properly with John holding me by the rein,
I begged him to let me go, and I promised
to ride quietly; but I whipped Frisk, and he
ran off so fast that I got frightened, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was very wrong of you, John, to allow
the child to ride without a rein, and I am
really angry and vexed that you should not
have taken more care of her when she was
left in your charge."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, I am very sorry, and it shall
never happen again," said John.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Mr. Dashwood; "and
as for you, Bunny, I am very much surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
that you should have been so naughty.
You know I told you you could not manage
Frisk without a leading rein."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you did, dear papa," said
Bunny, as she rubbed her little face up and
down against her father's cheek, "but don't
scold us any more. We are all very sorry,
aren't we, John?"</p>

<p>"Very, Miss," answered the groom; "I'd
rather have died than let any harm come to
you, an' I hope master will forgive me for
lettin' you have your own way about the
rein."</p>

<p>"I forgive you this time, John," said Mr.
Dashwood; "but remember for the future you
are to keep Miss Bunny well to your side
when you take her out to ride on her pony."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, surely I will," answered the
man earnestly; "I will never do what Miss
Bunny asks me to do again, never while I
live."</p>

<p>"And now, my dear fellow," said Mr.
Dashwood, turning to the young stranger
and shaking him once more by the hand, "I
cannot tell you how grateful I feel to you.
May I be permitted to ask your name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>"My name is Francis Collins; but indeed
I did not do much," the boy answered
modestly.</p>

<p>"You have done me a very great service,
Master Francis, and one that I can never repay
you," said Mr. Dashwood earnestly. "Do
you live anywhere about here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I live in London," replied the
lad; "my father is in India with his regiment,
and I am staying up here for a time with my
aunt."</p>

<p>"Is your father a captain? and is he in
India now?" asked Mervyn shyly.</p>

<p>"Yes, little man," answered young Collins
with a smile, "he is a captain in the 45th, and
is now stationed at Jublepoore."</p>

<p>"Why, Captain Collins is papa's great
friend, and of course he was my friend too;
and Mrs. Collins was so good and kind to me.
Oh, I did love her so much!" cried Mervyn,
looking up into the lad's face. "Are you the
Frank she used to talk to me about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am the Frank, her only child,"
said the boy sadly; "poor mother! it's a
whole year and a half since I saw her last;"
and tears came into his eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>"I have often heard my brother-in-law
speak of your father, my dear boy, and I am
very glad to have made your acquaintance,"
said Mr. Dashwood as he seated his little
daughter upon her pony. "Where are you
staying?"</p>

<p>"I am living with my aunt at a quiet hotel
on the West Cliff."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it," said Mr. Dashwood,
"for you will be able to come over and
see us. Our name is Dashwood, and we are
staying at Holly Lodge, a house standing in
its own grounds and facing the sea, yonder
on the South Cliff. Anyone will point it out
to you; so be sure and pay us a visit some
day soon."</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, I certainly will," the boy
replied with a bright smile; "I must have a
talk with this little chap, Mr. Dashwood, and
find out all I can about my father and mother
from him. By the by I suppose you are the
Mervyn Hastings she told me she missed so
much."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Mervyn Hastings; and oh, did
she miss me?" cried the little fellow eagerly.</p>

<p>"Most dreadfully! And I don't wonder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
for you seem to be a capital little fellow,"
said Frank Collins, patting Mervyn on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come over and lunch at the children's
dinner to-morrow at two o'clock, and then
you and Mervyn can have a long talk together,"
said Mr. Dashwood as he sprang to
his horse. "It is rather late now, so these
youngsters must get home as quickly as they
can. Remember we shall all be delighted to
see you, if you can spare time for visiting."</p>

<p>"Oh, do come, do come," said Mervyn,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Mama will be so glad to see you," cried
Bunny, "so do come, please."</p>

<p>"Thank you all very much," answered the
lad brightly; "I will be sure to be at Holly
Lodge by two o'clock. Good-bye, Mr. Dashwood;
good-bye, Miss Bunny; good-bye, little
Mervyn;" and Frank lifted his hat politely as
the riding party turned and rode away from
him down the drive towards Scarborough.</p>

<h3>MISS KERR PROMISES A PRIZE.</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap9_t.jpg" title="T" height="200" width="100" alt="T" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">he</span> next morning was very wet, and
as it was quite impossible for the
children to go out, Miss Kerr
insisted on their going into the
library to learn their lessons.</p>

<p>Bunny pouted and declared that her papa
did not wish them to sit still all day over
their books, and that it would be much nicer
to run about the house and play at "Hide
and seek."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would be pleasanter for you,
Bunny," said Miss Kerr, "but you forget that
'Hide and seek' is a very noisy game, and
that your mama's head is aching so much
that she could not bear the noise you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
be sure to make. Come now, be good children,
and try to learn your lessons as well as
you possibly can."</p>

<p>"I hate lessons! and so does Mervyn,"
cried the little girl in a cross voice. "Don't
you, Mervyn?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," answered the boy; "I will
go if you like, Miss Kerr, for I want to learn
how to write soon, that I may be able to send
papa a letter."</p>

<p>"You are a good boy, Mervyn," said the
governess with a smile as she took him by
the hand, "and I promise you that I will soon
let you write a little letter to your papa.
Come, Bun, dear, you are not going to be
naughty, I am sure. Come along and we'll
have such a nice quiet morning over our
books;" and she held out her other hand to
the little girl.</p>

<p>"Well, if I am good, will you read us a
story after we have said our lessons?" bargained
Miss Bunny; "I just love to hear you
read stories."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will read you a very nice story if
you are good, and I have a pretty box of
chocolate here that I will give to the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
who studies the hardest and keeps silence the
longest."</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice! Oh, how jolly!" cried
Bunny, clapping her hands in delight. "I'll
learn my lessons awfully hard;" and away she
ran down the passage to the library, pulled
her spelling-book out of the drawer, and
perching herself on a chair at the table began
to shout out the words at the top of her
voice.</p>

<p>"My dear Bunny, how do you think Mervyn
can learn his lessons if you scream
yours out in that way?" said Miss Kerr laughing;
"repeat those words quietly to yourself
whilst I show your cousin what he is to
do."</p>

<p>"I don't know very much, Miss Kerr," said
Mervyn shyly as he took the book from her
hand; "papa says I am a dreadful dunce, but
I only began to learn last year."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, my dear boy. If you
give your attention to your book and feel
anxious to learn, you will soon get on. Spell
over these words for me and let me see what
you can do."</p>

<p>Mervyn did as he was told, and with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
difficulty he managed to spell down half a
column of very easy words.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can do better than that! I can do
better than that!" cried Bunny, wriggling
about on her chair; "why, I could spell
those words in a minute. Listen&mdash;h-o-u-s-e,
d-a-y, m-o-u-s-e."</p>

<p>"Hush! Bunny, I cannot allow you to go
on like that," said Miss Kerr gravely; "you
have learned those words over and over again,
so of course you know them well. Now,
Mervyn, go and read them over by yourself
and I will hear you say them without the
book in a few minutes. Bunny, come and
say your lesson."</p>

<p>The little girl slipped off her chair and
came slowly across the room to Miss Kerr.</p>

<p>"Be quick, Bun, stir yourself," cried the
governess; "I want to hear how beautifully
you can spell words that you have never seen
before; come along."</p>

<p>But Bunny still hung back with an obstinate
look on her little face, that showed
plainly how very unwilling she was to do as
she was told.</p>

<p>"Come, dear child, be quick, you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
wasting all my time;" and Miss Kerr held
out her hand for the spelling-book.</p>

<p>Bunny handed it to her, and then dragging
one foot slowly after the other, she at last
stood by Miss Kerr's side.</p>

<p>"Take your finger out of your mouth,
Bunny," said the governess, as she laid the
book before the child and pointed to the place.
"Now begin, B&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you please, Miss Kerr," said Ashton,
opening the door. "Mrs. Dashwood wants
to see you very particular, miss, in the
drawing-room. She said as she wouldn't
keep you long, but you was to go to her at
once."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will go now, Ashton," said
Miss Kerr; "and now, children, I hope you
will be good while I am away. Bunny, you
can go over those words by yourself. See
here is the box of chocolate. I will put it in
the middle of the table so that you may see
what you have to work for;" and placing a
pretty cardboard box upon a pile of books
so that the children might see the gay picture
on the lid, she smiled kindly upon them both,
and hurried out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>For a few moments after they were left
alone the little people were very silent and
quiet; but soon Bunny raised her head,
yawned noisily, and pushing her book away
began to amuse herself by looking about the
room.</p>

<p>"I shall get the prize," said Mervyn, "you
are not learning your lesson, you know."</p>

<p>"No more are you," cried Bunny; "I'll
learn mine up in a minute when Miss Kerr
comes back, and you're as slow as an old snail
at yours;" and again she began to mimic his
voice and manner of spelling.</p>

<p>"You're very rude," cried Mervyn, getting
red, "and I'll just tell Miss Kerr when she
comes back."</p>

<p>"Tell-tale! tell-tale!" sang Bunny; "much
I care! If I know my lesson best I'll get
the chocolate and I won't give you one
bit."</p>

<p>"You're a greedy thing! But you won't
get it. I know my lesson splendidly, and
you don't know yours at all, so I am sure to
get the prize, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Ha, how grand you are, to be sure!"
screamed Bunny, and stretching out her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
she tried to pull the chocolate box towards
her.</p>

<p>"You sha'n't touch it! You sha'n't touch
it!" shouted Mervyn; "it isn't yours, so just
leave it alone."</p>

<p>"It isn't yours either," cried Bunny with
flaming cheeks, and she fastened her little
fingers more firmly than ever round the box.</p>

<p>"I am sure to get it, so I shall keep it
beside me till Miss Kerr comes back."</p>

<p>"No, you sha'n't," answered Mervyn in an
angry voice, and jumping up on his chair
he sprawled over the table and tried to drag
the box from Bunny's hand.</p>

<p>"You nasty boy, let go! I'll tell Miss
Kerr! I'll tell mama! You're a coward!
You're a horrid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's going to be tell-tale now?" shrieked
the boy. "Give it to me, I say, give it to me,"
and he gave a vigorous pull at the box.</p>

<p>But the cardboard of which the chocolate
box was composed was not strong enough to
stand such pulling, and before the naughty
children knew where they were it suddenly
gave way and came to pieces in their hands.
The beautiful prize was completely destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and its whole contents were strewn all over
the place.</p>

<p>"Now, see what you have done!" cried
Bunny, bursting into tears; "you have broken
the box&mdash;oh dear, oh dear, you cross, nasty,
greedy boy, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't do it," said Mervyn, but his
voice was low and shaky, for all his anger
disappeared when he saw the pretty box
torn to pieces and the chocolate creams lying
scattered about all over the table and floor.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did! If you hadn't pulled so
hard it would have been all right," said
Bunny tearfully. "Oh, what will Miss Kerr
say? I think I'll run away to the nursery
and hide. I shall be afraid to let her see
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That would be cowardly," answered Mervyn;
"I'm very sorry I pulled the box, and
I'll stay here and tell her so;" and he went
down on his knees and began to gather up
the sweetmeats and put them into a sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>"Don't eat any, Mervyn," said Bunny,
"they look awfully nice, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eat them!" exclaimed the boy indig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>nantly,
"I should think not indeed! I am
not so mean as that; I wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mean&mdash;is it mean?" cried Bunny, rubbing
her mouth; "oh, I didn't know, and I just
took one&mdash;but Miss Kerr won't mind."</p>

<p>"Well, you are nasty! You tell me not
to eat them, and then you go and take some
yourself. Go away, I won't speak to you or
be friends with you any more; you're a
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mervyn, Mervyn, I'm so sorry! I'm
so sorry!" cried Bunny, flinging herself on
her knees beside her cousin. "I didn't want
to take the chocolate cream, but it looked so
nice, and I just longed to take it and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Children! what are you doing?" cried
Miss Kerr in astonishment as her eyes fell
upon the two kneeling figures and she heard
Bunny's miserable tone of voice; "why are
you on the floor? Come back to the table
at once."</p>

<p>"Bunny," whispered Mervyn, "we must
tell Miss Kerr now what we have done;" and
springing to his feet he caught the little girl
by the hand and dragged her over to the
other side of the room, where the governess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
had seated herself, ready to begin lessons
again.</p>

<p>"We have been very naughty," he began,
looking down at the floor; "we didn't learn
our lessons&mdash;and&mdash;we&mdash;broke&mdash;the box&mdash;and
spilt all the chocolates&mdash;but we are very
sorry, indeed we are," and he raised his blue
eyes full of tears to Miss Kerr's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are very sorry&mdash;and&mdash;I eat a
chocolate cream&mdash;but Mervyn didn't because
it was mean," cried Bunny, and then, overcome
with grief, she buried her face in her
pinafore and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you how much surprised
and shocked I feel at such conduct," said
Miss Kerr gravely. "I really thought I
could trust you for a few minutes alone.
Mervyn, I am very much grieved to think
that you could behave in such a naughty way.
Bunny is wild and giddy, but I thought you
were going to show her a good example, by
being good and gentle yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I wanted to," said Mervyn,
"but she called me names and then I got
cross, and then&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I got cross too," cried Bunny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
putting down her pinafore for a minute. "I
was angry and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I am afraid you both forgot that
God was looking at you, and that he was
greatly displeased at you for giving way to
your wicked passions in such a manner.
How did you come to be so naughty? Mervyn,
what began it all?"</p>

<p>The tears were rolling down the little boy's
cheeks, but he dried them with his handkerchief,
and choking back those that were still
ready to flow, he tried to tell the story of
the torn chocolate box as well as he could.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad you have told me all
about it," said Miss Kerr, gently, "and as
you both seem so sorry for your conduct, I
suppose I must forgive you. But remember,
dear children, that you must tell God that
you are sorry, and ask him to forgive you.
Pray to Him that he may help you to overcome
your tempers and become good, gentle
little children. I will not scold you any
more, and you have punished yourselves
by breaking the box and spilling the sweetmeats,
for now I cannot allow you to have
any of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>"Oh, I don't mind that!" cried Mervyn
quickly. "If you will forgive me for being
naughty, I don't want any sweets."</p>

<p>"I do forgive you, Mervyn, but don't forget
what I told you. Say a prayer to-night
before you go to bed and ask God's forgiveness
and help."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, I will," cried the boy, "and
I will try and be ever so good all day to make
up for being so naughty this morning."</p>

<p>"And I'll be good too," said Bunny; "I
am sorry you won't give us any sweets, for
they look so nice, but still I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't ask for any! That is right,
dear. I know you like sweets, Bun, but I
must punish you a little, you know, so I can't
give you any to-day. Come, now, I forgive
you both, so let us go back to our lessons at
once; and I hope you will do your best to
show me that you are truly sorry, by working
very hard for the next two hours."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we will, indeed," cried the
children together, and off they ran to get
their books.</p>

<p>"That is right! That looks like real
work," said Miss Kerr, as she wrapped up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the chocolate creams in paper, and locked
them away in a drawer. "Come, Bunny,
bring your book to me, dear."</p>

<p>Bunny opened her spelling-book briskly,
Mervyn began to read his lesson attentively,
and perfect peace reigned once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> lessons were over about half-past
one, and as they had been well
learned and quickly said, Miss
Kerr was really pleased with the
children, and rewarded them for
their industry and attention by reading a
pretty story, that interested and amused
them very much.</p>

<p>This kept them pleasantly occupied until
nearly two o'clock, and then they ran off to
the nursery in high spirits, to get themselves
washed and dressed for their early dinner.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, Miss Kerr," said Bunny,
as she took her seat at the dinner-table, "I'm
really dreadfully sorry that nice boy we saw
yesterday has not come to have lunch with
us as he promised he would."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>"Yes, dear, so am I, for I should like very
much to see him," answered Miss Kerr, "but
I daresay the rain kept him from coming."</p>

<p>"But it's not raining one drop now," said
Mervyn, "and I declare, there is the sun
coming out; I do wish he would come."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's wet under-foot, Mervyn,"
remarked Bunny wisely, "and it's a bad
thing to get your feet wet&mdash;Sophie screams
fearfully at me if I put my toe out, even
long after the rain has stopped."</p>

<p>"Yes, when you go in your thin shoes, of
course," cried Mervyn; "but big boys like
Frank Collins are not afraid of wetting their
feet. Are they, Miss Kerr?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think they are, dear," answered
the governess, laughing, "I know my
brothers run out in all kinds of weather."</p>

<p>"Come in, my boy! Here they are at
their dinner," said Mr. Dashwood, opening
the door at this moment, and entering the
room with young Collins. "Miss Kerr, this
is our young friend who so bravely saved
poor Bunny yesterday," he added as he presented
Frank to the governess.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you, Master Collins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and these children have been longing for
you to come," said Miss Kerr; "it was very
brave of you to stop the pony."</p>

<p>"Brave! not at all, Miss Kerr," answered
Frank with a bright honest smile that won
the lady's heart at once. "I don't think the
pony was really running away, and if this
little girl," and he patted Bunny on the
head, "had not been frightened, but had sat
up properly and kept a good hold of her reins,
she would have been all right."</p>

<p>"Oh! Bunny, Bunny, you little coward,"
cried Miss Kerr, "and so, after all, it was you
who held on by the mane, and not Mervyn, as
you so gaily told him he would do yesterday."</p>

<p>"Did she tell him that?" asked Frank as
he took a seat at the table beside Mervyn.
"Well, I think this little chap would be the
bravest of the two in real danger. He would
not be so rash, perhaps, but I think he would
keep cool and not lose his head as she
did."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I was frightened," sighed Bunny.
"I was sure Frisk was running away;" and
she looked so very tearful that her papa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
kindly changed the conversation by asking
his young guest how he liked staying at
Scarborough.</p>

<p>"Are there many nice walks about?" asked
Mr. Dashwood, when they had all finished
their lunch and were preparing to leave the
table. "I mean short walks within easy
distance, where these little folks could go,
for instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's the old castle," said Frank,
"on the West Cliff, then there's the people's
Park in the valley, which of course you all
know well, and Oliver's Mount, which I think
the nicest walk of any."</p>

<p>"Oliver's Mount! Oh, that is a nice place,"
said Bunny, who had quite recovered her gay
spirits again. "Sophie says she went up there
one day with some friends, and she had
buns and lemonade and all kinds of things,
in a little house, a funny small house, she
says, that is up there on the top. Do take
us up Oliver's Mount, like a dear good
papa."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know the little house Sophie
means," said Frank; "it is only a small shed,
you can just see it from the window, look,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
there it is, right away up on the top of the
mount."</p>

<p>"It looks a great height, certainly," said
Mr. Dashwood. "I wonder if these little ones
could manage to go such a long way."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, we could, we could," cried the
children together.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I suppose we had better
set off at once," said Mr. Dashwood; "you
have no objection to my taking these small
people, Miss Kerr?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," she replied. "I was
going to send them with Sophie, but I am
sure they will enjoy going with you much
better. Mrs. Dashwood is not well enough
to go out, so I intend to read to her the
best part of the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that, for I was afraid
she might feel dull if we set off for a long
walk," said Mr. Dashwood. "Well, run
away, children, and get ready; the sooner we
start the better."</p>

<p>"It will be a long way for their little legs
if we go right to the top," said Frank doubtfully.
"Mervyn doesn't look very strong,
and Bunny's legs are very short."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>"Indeed they are not," cried Bunny indignantly.
"I can walk splendidly; can't I,
Miss Kerr?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, you are a very good walker
for your age and size."</p>

<p>"There, do you hear that?" cried Bunny,
jumping off her chair and throwing her arms
round her father's neck. "Do take us, do
take us, dear darling old papa."</p>

<p>"You little rogue!" cried Mr. Dashwood,
"I do believe you could coax the birds off
the bushes."</p>

<p>"No, papa, indeed I couldn't," answered
Bunny gravely; "I often tried, but they
would not come; and I tried to put salt on
their tails too, but they flew away and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You dear little goose, that was a great
shame; they must have been very rude birds
indeed, my poor Bun," said Mr. Dashwood
with a hearty laugh at the child's simplicity.
"You have coaxed me anyway, dear. I will
take you to Oliver's Mount; and I have
thought of a plan that will save your short
legs and Mervyn's weak ones a good deal."</p>

<p>"A plan! Oh! what is it? you dear,
darling papa," she cried joyfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>"No, I won't tell you, little one. Run off
and get dressed, and you will see what it is
when you come back. Away you go!&mdash;both
of you. Be quick, or Frank and I will not
wait for you."</p>

<p>Bunny and Mervyn were both very curious
to know what this wonderful plan of Mr.
Dashwood's could be, and chattered away
about it as they were being dressed by
Sophie.</p>

<p>"To the top of Oliver's Mount!" cried the
maid, holding up her hands in astonishment
when the children told her where they were
going. "Gracious! is it that monsieur your
papa knows how far it is? You will both
be too tired to return home to-night."</p>

<p>"Then we shall sleep in that little house
at the top, among the buns and the lemonade,"
said Mervyn. "That would be fine
fun, wouldn't it, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," replied the
little girl. "But do not be frightened,
Sophie; papa has a fine plan, so we sha'n't
be one bit tired. Come on, Mervyn," and,
laughing merrily, the two children ran off
together down-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>"Papa, papa! where is your plan?" cried
Bunny, as they met her father and young
Collins in the hall. "We do so want to
know what your wonderful plan can be."</p>

<p>"Here it is, then, my dear," said Mr. Dashwood,
and he threw open the door, and displayed
two steady-looking old donkeys
standing ready saddled at the gate. "You
are to ride one of those fellows, and Mervyn
the other. That is my plan; isn't it a good
one?"</p>

<p>"Capital! capital! What fun! what fun!"
cried the children, clapping their hands in
delight. "But, papa, the donkeys will never
go up the mountain," exclaimed Bunny suddenly;
"Sophie says there is a big stile to
get over, so how will they manage that?"</p>

<p>"We won't ask them to go over the stile,"
said Frank Collins, as he lifted the little girl
and seated her comfortably on the saddle.</p>

<p>"They will carry you up the road to the
foot of the Mount, and then we will leave
them there to rest and eat some grass, while
we go on our rambles up to the top."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a capital plan of papa's, Mervyn,
to get us these donkeys?" asked Bunny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
as she and her cousin jogged quietly along
the road on the steady old animals. "These
are such nice well-behaved creatures, and
don't run away in a hurry like Master Frisk."</p>

<p>"No, I should think not," answered Mervyn
laughing. "Why, just look at this
fellow," he cried as his donkey came to a
sudden stand-still in the middle of the road.
"What can we do to make him go on?
Here, boy, please make him move a little,"
he shouted to the donkey-boy, who was
loitering behind talking to a comrade.</p>

<p>"Hey up!" screamed the lad, running up
quietly from behind, and bringing his stick
down heavily on the poor brute's back;
"hey up, Teddy!" and away trotted the
donkey at a rapid pace up the hill.</p>

<p>When Bunny's charger saw his companion
starting off so gaily, he pricked up his ears
and followed him as fast as ever he could.</p>

<p>"Your plan was a capital one, uncle," said
Mervyn, as he and Bunny jumped off their
donkeys and prepared themselves to climb
over the stile and begin their walk up the
mount together.</p>

<p>"I suppose you feel as fresh as a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
daisies, and not at all shaken?" said Frank
Collins. "Come along and we'll have a race
to the very top;" and away he ran nimbly up
the side of the hill.</p>

<p>Bunny and Mervyn struggled bravely after
him, and they went so fast that they soon
left Mr. Dashwood behind them, for he
declared that he was too old to run, and that
he would follow them at his leisure.</p>

<p>The grass was very slippery after the rain,
and the mount was very steep, and so,
although the children went as fast as
their little legs could carry them, yet they
could not keep up with their young friend,
who soon appeared a long way above them,
waving a handkerchief, and cheering and
shouting at the top of his voice. But at last
they all reached the highest part of the
mount, and, puffing and panting after their
fearful exertions, they seated themselves upon
a bench and gazed about them in delight.</p>

<p>"Isn't it jolly up here, Mr. Dashwood?"
said Frank. "I think it would be worth
climbing ever so much higher to see such a
sight, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I do," answered Mr. Dash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>wood;
"and the air is very fine; it feels so
fresh and strong. That is the old castle
away over there, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes; and doesn't the old part of the
town, with its queer red brick houses and
narrow streets, look pretty? And look at
the bay in front of it, with its ships and
barges. Doesn't it all look lovely in the
sunlight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Frank, it does look pretty," cried
Mervyn; "and isn't the sea a beautiful blue
colour?"</p>

<p>"And don't our donkeys look funny little
gray fellows, away down there on the road?"
cried Bunny. "Oh, dear! they do look far
away."</p>

<p>"Bunny would rather look at her donkey
than all the beauties of the country," said
Mr. Dashwood with a smile, as he took his
little girl upon his knee. "But these youngsters
must not be defrauded of their cakes
and lemonade, Frank. Would you mind
going into that wonderful shop to see if you
can get some?"</p>

<p>"Oh! they have lots of good things in
there, I know," answered Frank. "I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
you will be able to eat a good supply,
Bunny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel able to eat several cakes,"
cried Bunny; "thank you, dear papa, for
thinking of them. I do love buns and lemonade.
Don't you, Mervyn?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bunny, very much," replied her
cousin.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall get scolded for letting
you have them," said Mr. Dashwood, as
Frank appeared, carrying an armful of cakes
and buns, and followed by a man with glasses
and bottles of lemonade.</p>

<p>"If you eat all these you won't be able to
take anything at tea, and then Miss Kerr
will be so dreadfully angry."</p>

<p>"Oh! never mind, papa, dear," cried
Bunny; "cakes and lemonade are just as
good as tea, but I will eat as much as ever
I can when I go home, and then no one will
scold you."</p>

<p>"That's a good, kind little woman," said
her father laughing; "but finish up those cakes
now as fast as you can, for I want to get
back to the club for an hour before dinner."</p>

<p>"I will just put this in my pocket for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
donkey-boy, papa," said the little girl, holding
up a bun which she could not manage to
eat; "he was very good, and made the donkeys
go so well."</p>

<p>"I think we will go round by the road,
Frank," said Mr. Dashwood, rising from the
bench; "it is not quite so steep as the
mount, and is very little longer."</p>

<p>"Very well; I daresay it will be the best
way to return; it will be a variety anyway,"
said Frank. "Mervyn, will you walk with
me? I want to talk to you about India and
all our friends there."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the little boy, "that is the
very thing I should like."</p>

<p>"But our donkeys&mdash;oh! are we not going
home on our donkeys?" cried Bunny.</p>

<p>"Of course we are, you little grumbler,"
said her father. "We are only going to walk
round by the road to them instead of tumbling
pell-mell down the hill again. Come
along with me, and let these two boys talk
over their affairs together."</p>

<p>Then, taking his little girl by the hand,
Mr. Dashwood walked quickly away with
her down the hilly road. Frank and Mervyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
followed them slowly arm-in-arm, and the
elder boy, with a look of yearning love in
his eyes, asked his small friend many
anxious questions about the dear father and
mother whom he had not seen for such a
long time.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap11_o.jpg" title="O" height="200" width="93" alt="O" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">ne</span> lovely afternoon towards the end
of September Mrs. Dashwood and
Miss Kerr sat together on the lawn
in front of the house. They were
stitching away at some pretty
clothes, that were evidently intended for a
large wax doll, with golden ringlets and blue
eyes, that lay on a table that stood between
them on the grass.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dashwood looked pale and delicate
still, but there was a well-pleased smile upon
her sweet face as she sat enjoying the sea
breezes. She was comfortably propped up
with pillows in a large wicker chair, and her
thin white fingers were busily engaged on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
her dainty work. The fresh country air had
done her great service, and she was full of
the hope that she should soon return quite
strong and well to town.</p>

<p>Bunny lay curled up in another big chair,
and although she knew very well that the
pretty doll was intended for her, she looked
very cross and did not seem to notice what
was going on about her.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go and play, Bunny?"
said Miss Kerr looking up from her work.
"I do not like to see you tumbling about
there with such a cross look on your face.
Go and get a book&mdash;or will you have a
needle and thread and try to do some
sewing?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," answered Bunny, "I
hate books and I can't sew."</p>

<p>"But you might learn, dear," said her
mother gently. "It is a great pleasure to
be able to sew, Bunny. I quite enjoy doing
my piece of work after being obliged to lie
on the sofa for such a long time."</p>

<p>"I don't want to learn to sew," cried
Bunny. "I want to have a game. I am
tired sitting here, mama. Oh, I do wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Mervyn and Frank would be quick and come
back."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Bunny, they will soon be
here," said Miss Kerr. "They promised to
be back at three and it wants a quarter to
three now, so you won't have very long to
wait."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm so glad!" cried Bunny; "I've
spent such a nasty dull day without
them."</p>

<p>"Well, really now!" said her mother laughing;
"that's a kind thing to say. I thought
my little girl liked being with me."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, mama, so I do," answered
Bunny quickly; "but Mervyn has been
away such a long time, and I do want him
to come back and have a good game with me.
He stayed to lunch with Frank up there at
the hotel, and Miss Kerr wouldn't let me go,
and oh, dear! I have been so lonely all
day."</p>

<p>"Poor little girl!" said her mother, "but
Miss Kerr was quite right not to let you go,
Bunny; Frank will have quite enough to do
to manage Mervyn. You are very hard to
keep in order, for you are very wild and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>"Oh! I'm not a bit wild now, mama; I'm
as quiet as a lamb&mdash;I am indeed."</p>

<p>"Bunny, Bunny, where are you, I say?&mdash;where
are you?" called Mervyn, running up
the garden walk and across the lawn.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Mervyn, and oh! I am so
glad you have come back," and the little girl
rushed forward eagerly to meet her cousin.
"But where is Frank? I thought he was
coming back with you."</p>

<p>"Yes, so he is. He will be here in a
minute; and he has something for you,
Bunny."</p>

<p>"Something for me, Mervyn; oh! what is
it?" she cried; "do tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"He'll tell you himself&mdash;he'll tell you
himself," answered Mervyn, and going down
on the grass, he tumbled heels over head two
or three times in succession.</p>

<p>"You tiresome boy," cried his cousin, "do
get up and tell me what Frank has for me,
and where he got it, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go and ask Frank himself&mdash;there he is,"
shouted Mervyn, starting quickly to his feet
again, as young Collins appeared suddenly at
the top of the flight of steps that led from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the drawing-room into the garden. His hands
were both behind his back, and he laughed
merrily when he saw Bunny's face of excitement
and curiosity as she ran across the
lawn to meet him.</p>

<p>"You dear good Frank, Mervyn says you
have something for me," she cried; "do tell
me what it is. I do so want to know."</p>

<p>"A bird, Bunny; a young thrush," said
Frank gaily, as he drew a small cage from
behind his back and held it up to the little
girl. "I put him in here because it was the
only thing I could find; but I will get you a
proper big cage for him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh! never mind the cage; but let me
see the bird," cried Bunny.</p>

<p>"He is rather frightened just now, Bun,
but I think he will soon sit up and begin to
sing; and thrushes do sing beautifully."</p>

<p>"He is a dear little fellow! a perfect darling!
But where did you get him, Frank?"
asked Bunny in delight, as she danced joyfully
round her new treasure. "Did you
manage to put salt on his tail?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't got a tail, Bunny," answered
Frank, laughing; "he is so young that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
hasn't got one yet. I caught him quite
easily in the hotel garden."</p>

<p>"Mama, Miss Kerr, look at the lovely bird
Frank has brought me," cried Bunny, running
back to her mother's chair.</p>

<p>"A bird, Frank?" said Mrs. Dashwood,
looking into the cage in surprise. "What a
pity it was to catch him and put him in
prison, poor little creature; he looks dreadfully
frightened."</p>

<p>"In prison, mama!" cried Bunny indignantly.
"Why, it's a lovely cage; and see,
he has water, and hard-boiled egg, and bread
sopped in water, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I see all those things, but
still he is in prison, Bunny," said Mrs. Dashwood
gently, "and I think it would have
been much kinder to have left him to fly
about the woods and sing his sweet songs in
happy freedom."</p>

<p>"I am afraid he will never sing again,"
said Miss Kerr as Frank placed the cage on
the table beside her; "he looks as if he were
going to die, I think; just see how he has
gathered himself up into a ball, and his eyes
are shut."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>"Oh! I hope he won't die," cried Frank;
"I am sorry I caught him, Mrs. Dashwood.
Shall I let him fly away again?"</p>

<p>"No, you sha'n't, Frank; he is my bird,
and you must not let him fly away," cried
Bunny; "I want to keep him."</p>

<p>"But, Bunny, your mama thinks he would
be glad to get away, so I would rather let
him go. Do say I may send him off."</p>

<p>"No, no, Frank, you sha'n't; I want him;
he's mine now," answered the little girl in an
angry voice; "I will have him and keep
him;" and making a dive across the table
she seized the cage and ran away with it
down the garden.</p>

<p>"Bunny! Bunny! come back this minute,"
cried her mother and Miss Kerr together.</p>

<p>"I'll soon bring her back!" exclaimed
Frank, and off he went after the runaway.</p>

<p>When Bunny heard footsteps behind her
she turned her head to see who it was that
was following her, and as she ran along without
looking where she was going, her foot
came against a stone, and down she went,
cage and all, upon the gravelled path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>"Oh, you cruel big boy!" she cried,
bursting into tears. "Why did you come
after me and make me fall in that way? I'll
never speak to you again&mdash;never;" and,
gathering herself up from the ground, she
began to rub her knees, and brush the dust
and sand off her frock.</p>

<p>"Now, don't be silly, Bunny," said Frank,
as he picked up the cage. "You are not a
bit hurt&mdash;but, look here! I believe you have
killed the poor bird."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, Frank, dear! oh! I didn't do
that!" sobbed the little girl, coming forward
and looking wistfully into the cage.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am afraid he is dead. He was
very much frightened before," said Frank
sadly, "and the shock of the fall, and all the
water and things falling on him have killed
him. I am so sorry. I wish, now, I had
left him to sing happily in the garden, Mrs.
Dashwood," he said, going back to where the
ladies sat together, carrying the poor dead
thrush in his hand. "You were quite right;
it was a great pity to take the poor bird and
put him in a cage. I will never catch a
young bird again&mdash;never."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>"Poor little creature! I thought it would
not live long," said Miss Kerr; "but, Bunny,
you were very naughty to run away with it
in that way; I am sure the fall helped to
kill the thrush."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to kill it!" cried Bunny
in a choking voice. "Oh! mama, I am so
sorry!" and she flung herself on the ground
beside her mother's chair, and buried her
face in her lap.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Bunny, dear," whispered
Mervyn softly, as he stole up and put his
arm round her neck. "Don't cry, dear; I am
sure it would have died very soon anyway.
Wouldn't it, Miss Kerr?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I think it would," said the
governess gently. "But what are you going
to do with the thrush, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I suppose I must bury it," answered
Frank; "I wish I had a pretty box to put it
in."</p>

<p>"I have one, I have one," cried Bunny,
jumping quickly to her feet, and running off
towards the house, mopping up her tears as
she went along. "I've got a dear little one
that will just do, Frank."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>"We must have a solemn funeral," said
young Collins. "Who will write an epitaph
to put at the head of his grave?"</p>

<p>"An epee&mdash;what, Frank?" asked Mervyn,
with a puzzled look on his little face. "What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"An epitaph, you little simple Indian;
do you not know what that means?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mervyn gravely, "I don't think
people in India ever have such things."</p>

<p>"Don't they indeed! Bunny, what is an
epitaph?" asked Frank, laughing merrily as
he took a pretty bon-bon box from the little
girl's hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure," said Bunny; "I
never heard of such a thing. What is it
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well, you are a clever pair! Why, it's
something written on a tombstone," cried
Frank, and, taking a piece of paper out of his
pocket, he scribbled a few words, and then
proceeded to read them aloud. "Listen and
learn what an epitaph is, my friends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block2" style="width: 400px;">
<p>"Beneath there lies a little thrush,<br />
Who should have sung on many a bush."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>"Capital!" said Miss Kerr, laughing merrily
at this brilliant production. "Why, you
are a regular poet!"</p>

<p>"It is very good indeed, Frank," said Mrs.
Dashwood with a bright smile. "Now,
Mervyn, I hope you know what an epitaph
is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said Mervyn slowly;
"but no one says bush like thrush. It
doesn't sound at all right."</p>

<p>"Hallo! young Indian, are you going to
find fault with my pronunciation? Isn't it
splendid, Miss Bun, bun?"</p>

<p>"I'm not bun, bun, and I think Mervyn
is quite right," answered the little girl with
a toss of her head. "It sounds very funny,
and all that, but it isn't the proper way to
say the word, I know."</p>

<p>"Of course not, little Miss Wisehead, but
we are allowed to say all kinds of things in
poetry," said Frank grandly; "and I can tell
you it's jolly convenient when a fellow wants
a rhyme. But now that we have decided
this knotty point, let us go and look for a
nice place where we can bury the little
fellow;" and, having placed the thrush in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
box, he went off to look for a suitable burying-place.</p>

<p>"Put him in my little garden," cried
Bunny eagerly. "There are lovely flowers
there, and we can make him such a nice
grave."</p>

<p>"Where is your garden, monkey?" said
Frank. "I did not know you had such a
thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have; at least I call it mine,"
answered Bunny, skipping gaily along.
"It's a dear little flower-bed down there by
the sun-dial, and it will be such a pretty
place for the poor dead bird. Do bury him
there, Frank."</p>

<p>"Very well; what pleases you pleases me,"
and off they went to Bunny's garden.</p>

<p>Very carefully Frank dug up the earth,
and, having placed the bird within the
grave, he filled it in neatly, took a lovely
geranium from a neighbouring flower-bed,
and planted it just over the poor songster's
head.</p>

<p>"We must water it," cried Bunny, "or it
will not grow," and away she rushed to the
tool-house. Here she found the gardener's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
watering-pot, and, unfortunately for them all,
it was more than half-full of water.</p>

<p>"This will make the flowers grow beautifully,"
she cried; and before the boys had
time to speak or stop her hand, she tilted up
the heavy pot and sent the water flying all
over their feet and legs.</p>

<p>"Oh! Bunny, Bunny! just see what you
have done," exclaimed Mervyn, beginning to
cry as he felt the cold water soaking in
through his stockings and shoes. "Oh, dear!
what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"You little mischief!" cried Frank, shaking
himself. "What on earth made you do
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I wanted the flower to grow," said
Bunny, bursting into tears, "and I did not
mean to wet you and Mervyn at all; and
look at my own pinafore and frock. Oh,
dear! what will Sophie say?"</p>

<p>"Sophie will say you are a naughty,
wicked little creature," cried the maid, darting
out suddenly from behind a tree. "Come
in this minute and get your things changed.
Monsieur Mervyn, go to the nursery at
once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>"I won't go! I won't go a bit!" cried
Bunny, stamping her foot angrily. "The sun
will dry me in a minute, and I won't go
with you; so there!"</p>

<p>"Come along, Bunny, like a good girl,"
said Mervyn, "let us run fast and see who
will get up to the nursery first," and away
he went up the path as fast as he could.</p>

<p>"I won't go, Sophie. I want to stay with
Frank," cried Bunny once more, as she caught
the boy's hand and held on to it tightly.</p>

<p>"You ought to go, dear, indeed you ought,"
said Frank. "See, Mervyn has gone, and
you know you should always do what Sophie
tells you."</p>

<p>"No, I won't; she's a nasty thing! and
it's twice as nice out here, so I won't go one
bit."</p>

<p>"Your mama and Miss Kerr have returned
to the house, and you must come in
and get changed your dress, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"I won't! I won't," shrieked Bunny, clinging
more closely to Frank, and turning her
back upon her nurse in a most impertinent
manner.</p>

<p>"We shall see if you do not, you bad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
naughty child," cried Sophie in an angry
voice, and running forward she seized the
little girl in her arms, and carried her off
screaming and kicking into the house.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap12_a.jpg" title="A" height="200" width="106" alt="A" /></div>
<p> <span class="smcap">little</span> before seven o'clock that
evening the children stood at the
drawing-room window. All traces
of the recent struggle in the garden
had been removed, and in the neat
little girl in the dainty cream lace and muslin
frock, with its fluttering pink ribbons, few
persons would have recognized the small
fury that Sophie had carried off wriggling
and crying to the nursery a few hours before.</p>

<p>But Miss Bunny had already forgotten
that such a scene had ever taken place, and
was making very merry over a big blue-bottle
fly that she and Mervyn were doing their
best to catch as it walked up and down the
window-pane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>Frank Collins sat at the piano playing
some very lively tunes, and from time to
time Bunny would pause in her pursuit of
the fly and dance lightly over the floor in
time to the music.</p>

<p>"Papa, papa," she cried, as Mr. Dashwood
entered the room with his wife upon his arm,
"doesn't Frank make lovely tunes?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear," answered her father.
"Frank does not seem anxious to let me hear
his music, for he has stopped short the
moment I appeared."</p>

<p>"I am afraid Mrs. Dashwood would not
care for my music," answered Frank modestly.
"I only play from ear."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, how can you say such a thing!"
cried Bunny indignantly. "Why, mama, he
plays just like Miss Kerr does. He plays
away up in the treble with two hands, and
then he plays pum, pum, pum away down in
the bass; oh, it is most beautiful! Do play
again, Frank."</p>

<p>"No, dear, not now," said Frank. "I'll play
for you another time, but don't ask me now;"
and he hopped the little girl up on his knee.</p>

<p>"Well, then, ask&mdash;you know what," whis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>pered
Bunny mysteriously. "You know you
said you would&mdash;you promised."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course; I very nearly forgot,"
said Frank, "and I suppose Sophie will soon
be carrying you off to bed, it's nearly half-past
seven."</p>

<p>"Yes, she will, unless you ask that, and
papa and mama say, Yes."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dashwood," said Frank, "it's a gala
night, as they call it, on the Spa, and there
are to be fireworks, so will you let these
little people stay up for them? Please do."</p>

<p>"What! to go out in the night air and
into the crowd?" asked Mrs. Dashwood in a
horrified voice. "My dear Frank, I could not
think of allowing such a thing. It is quite
impossible!"</p>

<p>"Of course it is, Mrs. Dashwood," answered
Frank. "But I did not mean them to go out
at all, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear mama," cried Bunny eagerly,
"Frank does not want us to go out, but to
sit up and see them from Miss Kerr's window,
that is all."</p>

<p>"Bunny, come here, dear, I want to have
a talk with you," said her mother gravely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and guessing that she was going to receive
a scolding for her naughty conduct in the
garden, the child stole slowly over the floor,
and at last stood in rather a shamefaced
manner beside her mother's chair.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Bunny, that a little girl
who screamed and kicked as you did when
Sophie took you in out of the garden, deserves
to be allowed to stay up to see the fireworks?"</p>

<p>"No, mama," answered Bunny in a low
voice, and two large tears trickled down her
cheeks and fell on her mother's hand.</p>

<p>"Auntie, dear, don't scold poor Bunny, for
she is very sorry she was naughty, and she
begged Sophie's pardon before we came down."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to hear that, Mervyn,"
said Mrs. Dashwood, "and I hope Bunny is
sorry; but I don't think she should be allowed
to stay up to see the fireworks, she cannot
expect it."</p>

<p>"Why, mama, what is all this about?"
said Mr. Dashwood, coming over and putting
his arm round his little daughter. "Why
are you scolding poor Bunny so much?"</p>

<p>"Because I was naughty, papa," said Bunny,
creeping up very close to him. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
I am very sorry, and I promise to be
good."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, don't scold her any more, dear,"
said her papa, stroking the little golden head,
"she can't do more than promise to be a good
child."</p>

<p>"And do forgive her, and let her stay up
to see the fireworks," whispered Mervyn, "it
would be such fun!"</p>

<p>"What is that you are saying, Mervyn?
What dreadful plot are you hatching over
there?" cried Mr. Dashwood, "why, the fireworks
don't go off until nine, and your bedtime
is at half-past seven, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it is, uncle, but we're not a
bit sleepy, and we never saw any fireworks,
and this is the last gala night before we leave
Scarborough, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Mervyn, what a string of reasons!"
cried his uncle laughing; "after such
a list, I think we must surely grant your
request. That is, if mama will forgive this
poor culprit, and allow her to stay up."</p>

<p>"Well, as she is sorry, and as Mervyn
says it is the last night, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's right! that's right!" said her hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>band,
"and now let us go in to dinner. This
animated discussion has given me quite an
appetite."</p>

<p>And as Ashton at this moment threw open
the door, and announced that dinner was
served, Mr. Dashwood offered his arm to
his wife, and led her away to the dining-room.</p>

<p>"What fun! what fun! to be allowed to
stay up to see the fireworks," cried Bunny,
and catching hold of Frank's arm she hurried
him off after her papa and mama.</p>

<p>"Now, you must sit quiet, children," said
Mrs. Dashwood; "if you make a noise I shall
have to send you away to the nursery."</p>

<p>"We'll be as quiet as mice," said Bunny,
and pulling Mervyn down on a large woolly
mat in the middle window, she began to
whisper joyfully about the treat that was in
store for them before the evening was over.</p>

<p>The first part of the dinner seemed rather
long to the two little ones in their corner, but
when at last the dessert was placed on the
table, and Bunny was seated at her papa's
elbow, and Mervyn between his aunt and his
dear friend Frank, they all became so merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
together, that the fireworks were for the
time completely forgotten.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I heard such a funny noise just
now," cried Bunny suddenly, "what can it
be? Listen, there it is again&mdash;whizz&mdash;whizz&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's the first rocket, I'm sure!" exclaimed
Frank, dropping the nut-crackers, "let us go
off to a window somewhere, for I am sure the
fireworks are going to begin."</p>

<p>"How jolly!" cried Mervyn. "Aunt, may
we run up to Miss Kerr's room?"</p>

<p>"Can't we see them from here?" asked Mr.
Dashwood, pulling up the blind and looking
out. "What a beautiful dark night it is!
Better stay here, chicks, I think. See, there
goes another rocket!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is lovely!" cried Bunny, clapping
her hands. "But, papa, dear, we can see them
much better from Miss Kerr's room, she has
such a nice balcony, and she promised to let
us go up to it if mama would allow us."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, away you go," said her
father; "but be quick, or you will lose all the
fun."</p>

<p>"Be sure and wrap yourselves up, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
children, if you go out into the balcony,"
said Mrs. Dashwood. "The night air is very
sharp."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mama, we will make ourselves as
warm as toast," cried Bunny gaily. "Come,
Frank, do come up to the balcony with us."</p>

<p>"All right, little woman, jump upon my
back and we'll run a race with Mervyn."</p>

<p>Very much delighted at such an invitation,
Bunny sprang from a chair on to Frank's
back, and away they went galloping madly
after Mervyn, up the stairs and along the
passage to Miss Kerr's room. There they
found Sophie waiting for them, heavily laden
with cloaks and shawls in which she insisted
on wrapping them up till they were nearly
smothered, and shrieked wildly for just one
little space through which they might manage
to breathe.</p>

<p>"Very well, you will all catch your deaths
of colds," cried Sophie. "Miss Bunny, you
will want the doctor to-morrow, I am quite
sure;" and she flounced out of the room and
banged the door after her.</p>

<p>"Good riddance to bad rubbish!" cried
Frank, laughing, as he released poor Mervyn's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
face from the thick shawl in which the maid
had rolled him up. "She's an awful scold
that Sophie."</p>

<p>"But she's jolly kind to us sometimes,"
said Mervyn stoutly; "and we torment her
dreadfully, don't we, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we do indeed," answered the little girl;
"and she doesn't always scold, Master Frank."</p>

<p>"Goodness me! don't be so indignant," cried
Frank. "I meant no offence. I daresay
Sophie is a regular angel."</p>

<p>"She's not quite that," said Miss Kerr as
she opened the window and let the young
people out upon the balcony. "But I am
glad to hear the children stand up for her,
for, as Mervyn says, they do torment her,
and still she is very good-natured and kind
to them on the whole."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed she is," said Mervyn; "but
oh! just look at that, isn't it exquisite?"</p>

<p>"Lovely!" cried Frank. "It's a regular
shower of golden hail! But I think I like
the Roman candles best. Look, Bunny,
there's one&mdash;see&mdash;those two stars&mdash;watch
how they change colour&mdash;first they're red&mdash;then
blue&mdash;then&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>"Oh, yes, yes," cried Bunny dancing about.
"There they go, right away over the sea!
What lovely things fireworks are!"</p>

<p>"It is a pity we could not have gone
down on the Spa to see the set pieces," said
Frank. "I believe they are most beautiful.
But then the crowd is something dreadful."</p>

<p>"Do they send the fireworks up from the
Spa?" asked Mervyn; "they look just as if
they were coming from the road up there in
front of the Crown Hotel."</p>

<p>"No, they are sent from a place just over
the Spa, up among the trees there, but a long
way below the hotel."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! there goes a splendid rocket,"
cried Mervyn, "and doesn't it make a lovely
noise?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I can't bear the noise," said Bunny,
putting her fingers in her ears, "it makes me
jump."</p>

<p>"Now that is really charming!" said Miss
Kerr, as the whole bay with its ships and
boats was suddenly illuminated by a brilliant
crimson light. "How lovely everything looks
in that soft, rich colour!"</p>

<p>"Oh! and I declare you can see Oliver's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Mount and the dear little cake shop," cried
Bunny. "And, Mervyn, I wonder where our
old donkeys are to-night," and she peered
away out in the direction of the sands where
the poor animals usually spent their days.</p>

<p>"At home in their beds, my dear," said Miss
Kerr laughing, "and that's where small people
like you should be; it must be near ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh! not yet, not yet," cried the children;
"we must stay and see the last of the fireworks!"</p>

<p>"That is the last now, I'm sure," said
Frank. "That thick yellow light comes
from the grand finale, which we cannot see&mdash;ha!
there goes another rocket. Hurrah!
the whole thing is at an end."</p>

<p>"Very well, my dears, you must say good-night,"
said Miss Kerr; "your poor little eyes
are positively blinking with sleep, Bunny,
dear."</p>

<p>"No, they're not," said the little girl, "but
they feel funny and won't go quite straight."</p>

<p>"Are you getting a squint, then?" said
Frank. "Come along, old lady, a few hours'
sleep will make them go straight enough;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and putting one arm round Bunny and the
other round Mervyn, he marched them off to
the nursery, where he deposited them one
after the other on their little beds.</p>

<p>The children were really quite tired out
with excitement, and the fatigue of sitting
up to such an unusually late hour; so when
Frank left them for the night, they did not
utter a word or make a complaint. They
said their prayers, were undressed at once,
and, laying their weary heads upon their
pillows, were soon fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">t</span> is to be hoped that you see some
improvement in Bunny's behaviour
since you first made her acquaintance,
though she was very naughty
on the day when the poor thrush
was killed.</p>

<p>At all events she had been trying to be
good, and when she failed, or forgot her good
resolutions she was so willing to confess her
faults, and was so truly sorry for them, that
Miss Kerr and Mama, and even Sophie, were
always ready to forgive her. Miss Kerr had
quite won Bunny's heart by her constant
love and gentleness, so that the child could
not bear to give her pain. This made
Bunny more thoughtful, and she soon learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
to check her outbreaks of temper and to
keep out of mischief.</p>

<p>Mervyn, who was growing tall and strong,
was very much in earnest when he had promised
to try to be docile and obedient. He
did not forget that should he meet his dear
mother and father in London they would ask
him whether he had kept his word, and he
would not have told them a falsehood even
if he had been ever so naughty, for he was a
truthful boy, and not at all a coward.</p>

<p>Mervyn often helped Bunny to remember
her promises too; and it seemed as though
after the night when they had seen the display
of fireworks they had both made up their
minds to go on steadily with their lessons
every morning. Miss Kerr was delighted, and
Sophie had really very little to do, for all the
afternoon, and sometimes in the evening also,
they were out on the sands, or on the hills,
or seated in the garden. The reason of this
was, that as Mr. Dashwood had given them
notice that the holiday was coming to an
end, they had implored their friend Frank
Collins to come often to see them, and as he
loved Mervyn and could talk to him about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
his dear father and mother, and listen to his
descriptions of life in Madras and Calcutta,
he used to come every day to take the children
out.</p>

<p>Of this Mr. Dashwood was very glad, for
he was pleased that such a nice manly boy as
Frank should give up so much time to these
two young ones, and used to laugh at Miss
Kerr and tell her that they learnt more from
their young tutor Frank Collins than they
did from their governess. Miss Kerr often
made one of the party when they went out
together and she used to like to listen to
Frank too. He had been to a large school,
and was now only waiting for his parents
to return from India before going to another.
He had read a great many books, and could
remember several stories and accounts of
voyages and discoveries.</p>

<p>The children would sit under a tree or
inside an old boat on the beach and listen
to him as he told them of the adventures of
sailors and travellers; or sometimes they
went with him for a ramble in the country,
and he could show them the different
kinds of trees and wild flowers, and point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
out where the various birds built their
nests.</p>

<p>Mervyn was quite surprised one day when
a lark sprang suddenly from a field of long
grass and went soaring up and up in the
clear sunshine till it looked only like a speck,
and at last could scarcely be seen, but yet all
the time kept trilling and singing its beautiful
song.</p>

<p>As it sung it floated away to some distance
from the place from which it rose, and then
suddenly it seemed to sink from the air and
to drop amidst the grass again.</p>

<p>"Wherever has it gone to?" said Bunny;
"there are no trees here, and where can its
nest be?"</p>

<p>"Its nest is on the ground, in the long
grass of the field," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Oh then, it has just dropped into it,"
cried Mervyn; "couldn't we go and see?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't find it except you could
trace the way to the spot where the bird first
rose," said Frank. "Directly the artful fellow
heard us coming he sprang out and started his
song so that he might lead us away from the
spot where the nest is, and now he has dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
in the grass a long way off to lead us still
further away."</p>

<p>"Oh <i>do</i> let us go and look for it!" said
Bunny.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better not," said Mervyn;
"remember the thrush, Bunny, and we might
kill some of the little birds."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Mervyn," said Frank Collins;
"we should very likely step upon it or
frighten the hen bird so much that she
would leave the nest. It would be like
somebody coming and driving us away from
home, you know. When I was as young as
you are, I used to rob the nests of their eggs,
but I have left off doing so now, and even if
you should ever collect eggs you should only
take one from a nest and contrive not to
frighten the birds. But there are young
larks and not eggs in this nest, so we will let
them alone to grow strong and fly out into
the sunshine and sing under the blue sky,
won't we, Bunny?"</p>

<p>You may well believe that the children
thought the last part of their holiday was the
pleasantest of all; for beside Frank they had
found another playmate, a great friend of his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>His name was Captain, and he was a
grand, black, curly, Newfoundland dog. Such
a fine fellow was seldom to be seen, and he
learnt to lie down in a patch of grass on the
hill, just at the place where he could watch
for Bunny and Mervyn when they went out
for their afternoon walk.</p>

<p>He would pretend to be asleep, and when
they came quite close to him would spring up
and begin to leap about, leading the way to
the sands, and barking or rolling over and
over till Frank or Mervyn threw a stick as
far as ever they could into the sea that he
might dash in after it and fetch it out.</p>

<p>Captain was a splendid swimmer, and had
once jumped into the sea from the end of a
pier after a little girl who had fallen into the
water. The child would have been drowned,
but Captain seized her by the frock and held
her up till a boat could put out and fetch
her, and then the brave fellow turned and
swam ashore.</p>

<h3>BUNNY'S IMPROVEMENT. <span style="padding-left: 1em;">HOME AGAIN.</span></h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/chap14_t.jpg" title="T" height="200" width="101" alt="T" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">he</span> time had arrived when the holiday
at Scarborough was to come
to an end. The last evening was
spent on the cliff. It was while
they were all sitting on the hillside
looking out to sea that Frank began to
talk to them about "lighthouses," those tall
buildings, having a strong lantern at the top,
the bright light from which can be seen
far out at sea, so that sailors may know to
what part of the coast they are going, and
may steer their ships in such a direction as
to avoid danger, or guide them into a place
of safety.</p>

<p>Then Miss Kerr told them a story about
a lighthouse, and how a brave and thoughtful
little girl was able to save a great ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
from being dashed to pieces on the rocks.
This lighthouse was at a very dangerous part
of the coast, and every day the lamps had to
be cleaned and fresh oil put in them, and the
great metal "reflectors" that were behind
the lamps and threw the light far out to
sea had to be burnished.</p>

<p>The little girl was the child of the keeper
of the lighthouse, and he often took her with
him to stay there. He had a companion, for
in lighthouses there are mostly two men; but
one day this companion slipped off the ladder
up which he had to climb to light the
lamps in the great lantern, and broke his
leg. At the same time he struck his head
and became insensible, and so the father of
the little girl was obliged to leave her and
to fetch a doctor. He meant to come back
very soon, but the doctor was out, and in
trying to find him he was away for many
hours, and by the time he could get down
to his boat a great storm had come on, and
the waves were breaking over the shore so
that he could not put out to sea again.</p>

<p>Night was coming on, and the poor fellow
paced the beach and wondered what was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
be done, for it would soon be time for the
lamps to be lighted, and there was nobody
in the lighthouse but the helpless man and
his little girl. The sailors and fishermen all
came round, but it would have been a desperate
venture to put out a boat in such a
storm, and with the great waves roaring and
leaping on a long sharp ridge of rocks quite
close to where the lighthouse stood, nobody
could have expected to reach it alive.</p>

<p>At last, just as the night was coming on,
the poor fellow prepared to risk his life rather
than leave the ships that might be far off at
sea without a guide or a warning; but six
strong men dragged a large boat down to
the edge of the shore where the waves were
lowest, and agreed to share his danger. Their
hands were on the boat ready to push her
in and then scramble to their places; an old
fisherman was in his seat ready to steer, when
he suddenly gave a shout and pointed towards
the lighthouse.</p>

<p>There from the lantern high above the
roaring waves shone the brilliant beams of
the lamps, and with a hearty cheer the brave
fellows drew the boat back, and shading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
their eyes with their hands stared as though
they had never seen the familiar light before.</p>

<p>All night long they watched, till at break
of day the storm abated, the sea grew still,
and far far away they could see a great three-masted
ship rolling and tossing, with one of
her sails blown to rags, but still keeping off
the shore. The pilot had seen the lights,
and so knowing how to steer had kept her
away from the rocky reefs where she might
have been dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>It was not till the sun rose high and they
were able to go out in their boats that the
men on shore could take the doctor to the
lighthouse, and then they found the little
girl kneeling beside the injured man and
feeding him with some cold tea which had
been left in the teapot. He had come to
his senses, and had tried to crawl to the ladder,
when he heard her voice singing softly
right up in the lantern. He contrived to
drag himself along the floor of the room, and
could just see a gleam from one of the lamps
coming through the chinks of the wood-work.
The child, when she found her father did not
return, had grown afraid; but her great fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
was that the lamps would not be lighted, and
as the place grew dark she made up her
mind to try to light them herself. She had
seen her father clean the lamps, and had been
with him up the ladder, holding his strong
hand; and she knew too where the match
was kept, for she had been shown everything
about the place while she was there on those
long days alone with her father till the other
man came on duty in the evening. So up
she went, softly singing a hymn to herself,
and after steadying herself by one of the iron
rods that supported the lantern, put the
lighted match to the wick, and was so startled
to see the great yellow glare that shone from
the reflector that she nearly lost her balance.
When she reached the bottom of the ladder
she found her friend looking at her quite
wide awake; but he could do nothing to help
her, except by telling her how to manage
the light, and also how to move up there in
the great glass lantern of the lighthouse, so
that she might reach each lamp in turn.</p>

<p>When her father came up the steep stair,
followed by a dozen of his comrades, she gave
a cry of delight and was in his arms in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
moment; and she was soon made such a pet
of by the men there that they all wanted
her to accept knives, and rings, and pocket
combs, and even tobacco-boxes, because they
had nothing else to offer her; but she had
her father and that was quite enough for
her, and as he held her to his breast she
could feel his tears fall upon her head, and
yet he was as brave as any man who lived
upon that coast.</p>

<p>"However could she do it?" said Bunny,
who had earnestly listened to this story.</p>

<p>"She forgot all about herself, Bunny, and
thought only of other people and of the duty
that was straight before her," said Frank
gently.</p>

<p>Bunny remained very serious all the rest
of the evening; perhaps the story of the
child lighting the lamps reminded her of the
trick she had played poor old Ashton when
she poured water into his wine-glasses.</p>

<p>But as we have seen already, Bunny was
improving, and her mama was indeed delighted
to notice the change, and quite shared
her sorrow that they were so soon to leave
for London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>A day or two before they had begun to
pack up Mr. Dashwood brought the children
glorious news. Frank Collins was to go to
London and stay with them till the arrival
of his mother, who was on her voyage home
and would be in England in a few days.
Then he was to go to school, and perhaps
Mervyn would some day be sent to the same
school, but of course in a lower class.</p>

<p>This last part of it was not very cheering
for poor Bunny, and she was ready to cry;
but she looked at Miss Kerr's kind gentle
face and saw the look of joy in Mervyn's
eyes, and so she choked back her tears, and
presently when Mervyn said softly, "Of
course I can't help being glad, Bunny, but
I shall never be anything but sorry to be
parted from you;" she was ready to say,
"And I shall be awfully sorry, Mervyn dear,
but then when the holidays come we shall
both know so much more, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here poor Bunny broke down and hid
her face in her pinafore. But the next day
she had recovered her spirits, and she and
Mervyn were talking over their future plans,
for it would be some months before her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
cousin would know enough to enter even the
lowest form. But one chief reason for their
rapid recovery of spirits was that it would
be a whole month or more before Frank
himself could begin his studies, and there
were promises of visits to the Zoological
Gardens, the great Palm House at Kew, the
old Tower of London, and other places which
would remind them of the stories they had
heard, and of the books which they had yet
to learn to read.</p>

<p>They had all these things to talk about
when they found themselves in the train
that was to carry them home, and were so
full of plans and expectations that they were
many miles upon the journey before they
remembered that they had not waved a
good-bye to their old friend Oliver's Mount,
or thought of the sorrow of leaving Scarborough
for smoky, noisy, old London.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
